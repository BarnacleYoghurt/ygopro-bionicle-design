		"Toa Mata Onua" + 1 "Energized Protodermis" monster
		If this card is Fusion Summoned: You can add 1 "Nuva" Spell/Trap from your Deck or GY to your hand, then discard 1 card.  During the Main Phase (Quick Effect): You can target 1 card in either GY; place it on the top or bottom of the Deck, then gain 1000 LP. You can only use each effect of "Toa Nuva Onua" once per turn.

		{{Fusion Summon}}
		{{Send 1 monster on the field to the GY}}
		
		SS from hand going 2nd so the NS remains usable for something else
		Fuse by dumping a monster from your hand into the Pool
		If forcibly used as material by another fusion effect, that transformation goes against Destiny, and so the Energized Protodermis will exhibit destructive properties (but not necessarily aimed at the summoned monster)
		
		Has to be a Tube (TODO: Better word?) because the monster "descends" into it like the Toa Mata after the Bahrag (and it happens suddenly on summon, too)
		=> Would Pool then be something involving multiple monsters at once (i.e. Takutanuva)?
		=> Technically, going by the novel version, the tubes do lead into a pool ... but in the comic, the EP is directly inside the tubes instead, and this is still during the Hapka books so the comics might actually be more canon in this case
		==> Comic uses the word "chamber" at one point, we can probably go with that

		Magnetize target monster to prevent it from attacking (see: Gahlok-Kal vs Lewa), can also take out another monster by making it "stick" to the target (see: Pohatu and the Mahi)
		=> stealthy non-targeting removal, befitting of Gahlok-Kal's ability to solve all kinds of problems
		==> would kinda like it to work on S/T too, but the mechanics of turning those into equips seem a bit problematic
		=> may be too strong for 1 mat, but is 2 mat worth it when it's not even quick (and quick would be a bit OP...)?
		==> limiting the timing to start of BP may be a reasonable extra condition
		==> if equipping anything from the field is too powerful after all, a stylish way to nerf it would be only equipping monsters in the same or an adjacent column (see Scareclaws for wording) - limiting the range of the magnets

		Place materials detached from this card on the bottom of the Deck, instead of sending them to the GY. Once per turn: You can attach 1 "Krana" monster from your hand, field, or GY to this card as material.

		{{Add a card to hand}}

		{{Negate "Toa Nuva Onua" and banish card from hand}}
		
		Effect structure for Nuva Symbols:
		=> Can only control 1 each
		==> mostly so soft OPT won't get too out of control
		=> HOPT place self on bottom of Deck to search matching Toa Mata
		==> Lets the Nuva Symbol act as additional copies
		==> Returning to deck offsets the plus, avoids triggering "leaves the field"
		==> Maybe there's some other reasonable target rather than just the one Toa specifically (which also overlaps with Mata Kanohi)?
		===> 4.0.1: We now search both the matching Toa Mata and EP cards, so we can always grab the missing component
		=> Soft OPT granting some significant bonus to all Toa Nuva while you control the matching one
		==> 4.0.2: LP gain didn't seem significant enough, so now we instead have basically Heatsoul, which is free (and can potentially add any card from GY) if combined with Onua's effect
		===> arguably we could drop the OPT since we have a LP cost and all the Nuva effects are HOPT (so it wouldn't be crazier than, say, Hyper Librarian), but that seems a bit too much and also gets weird with triggers off multiple effects in the same chain
		=> Mandatory "leaves the field" trigger that negates the matching Toa Nuva and inflicts some drawback opposed to the bonus from the previous effect
		==> 4.0.2: Let's see if a mandatory -1 is too much of a drawback, would be the logical opposition to draw 1 after all

	rule text: You can only control 1 "Nuva Symbol of Deep Wisdom". You can place this card you control on the bottom of the Deck; add 1 "Energized Protodermis" card or "Toa Mata Onua" from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of "Nuva Symbol of Deep Wisdom" once per turn. Once per turn, if a "Nuva" Fusion Monster you control activates its effect while you control "Toa Nuva Onua": You can pay 1000 LP; draw 1 card. If this card leaves the field: Target 1 "Toa Nuva Onua" you control; negate its effects, and if you do, banish 1 card from your hand face-down.

card:
	has styling: false
	notes:
		{{Place "Nuva" Continuous Spell from Deck}}
		{{Make all monsters you control gain 500 ATK}}
		
		Effect structure for Nuva Kanohi:
		=> If sent to GY, search an EP card (HOPT)
		==> this way, even bricking on Nuva Symbols and Kanohi will net you the fusion materials for a Toa Nuva
		==> this is the first thing we'd drop if we need to save words
		==> 4.0.1: instead keep the original banish cost (to show the connection between the two Pakaris), but as payoff place a Nuva Symbol - that can then do the searching
		===> maybe it should be Deep Wisdom specifically, to keep the connection between Onua and his mask?
		===> allows using a Toa Nuva's search and discard to get a Nuva Symbol on the field even with an empty hand, so that's a nice benefit of running both Symbols and Kanohi
		=> Two effects while equipped to a Toa Nuva
		==> one that (usually passively) affects the wearer only
		==> one that can be (SOPT) activated to grant a lesser version of the power to your whole field for a time
		
		Due to technical limitations, we can't support "Toa Nuva", so let's go for "Nuva" Fusions instead
		=> might become a problem with the Nuva Kaita (and later Phantoka/Mistika), though...
		==> if we just demand "Nuva" monsters in general, it would also work with Takanuva, so that's wrong (also "Nuva" Fusion Monsters might be a problem in its own right regarding Takutanuva)
		=> perhaps the only future-proof solution is making "Toa Nuva" a separate archetype after all, and then just never make support for "Nuva" monsters to keep things simple
