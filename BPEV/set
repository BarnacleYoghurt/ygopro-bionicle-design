		SS from hand going 2nd so the NS remains usable for something else
		Fuse by dumping a monster from your hand into the Pool
		If forcibly used as material by another fusion effect, that transformation goes against Destiny, and so the Energized Protodermis will exhibit destructive properties (but not necessarily aimed at the summoned monster)
		=> might be good to restrict this to Special Summoned monsters only, so it's a bit more of a drawback
		
		Has to be a Tube (TODO: Better word?) because the monster "descends" into it like the Toa Mata after the Bahrag (and it happens suddenly on summon, too)
		=> Would Pool then be something involving multiple monsters at once (i.e. Takutanuva)?
		=> Technically, going by the novel version, the tubes do lead into a pool ... but in the comic, the EP is directly inside the tubes instead, and this is still during the Hapka books so the comics might actually be more canon in this case
		==> Comic uses the word "chamber" at one point, we can probably go with that

		Magnetize target monster to prevent it from attacking (see: Gahlok-Kal vs Lewa), can also take out another monster by making it "stick" to the target (see: Pohatu and the Mahi)
		=> stealthy non-targeting removal, befitting of Gahlok-Kal's ability to solve all kinds of problems
		==> would kinda like it to work on S/T too, but the mechanics of turning those into equips seem a bit problematic
		=> may be too strong for 1 mat, but is 2 mat worth it when it's not even quick (and quick would be a bit OP...)?
		==> limiting the timing to start of BP may be a reasonable extra condition
		==> if equipping anything from the field is too powerful after all, a stylish way to nerf it would be only equipping monsters in the same or an adjacent column (see Scareclaws for wording) - limiting the range of the magnets

		Effect structure for Nuva Symbols:
		=> Can only control 1 each
		==> mostly so soft OPT won't get too out of control
		==> 4.1.3: We need to simplify, so let's drop this and use HOPT instead
		=> HOPT place self on bottom of Deck to search matching Toa Mata
		==> Lets the Nuva Symbol act as additional copies
		==> Returning to deck offsets the plus, avoids triggering "leaves the field"
		==> Maybe there's some other reasonable target rather than just the one Toa specifically (which also overlaps with Mata Kanohi)?
		===> 4.0.1: We now search both the matching Toa Mata and EP cards, so we can always grab the missing component
		=> Soft OPT granting some significant bonus to all Toa Nuva while you control the matching one
		==> 4.0.2: LP gain didn't seem significant enough, so now we instead have basically Heatsoul, which is free (and can potentially add any card from GY) if combined with Onua's effect
		===> arguably we could drop the OPT since we have a LP cost and all the Nuva effects are HOPT (so it wouldn't be crazier than, say, Hyper Librarian), but that seems a bit too much and also gets weird with triggers off multiple effects in the same chain
		==> 4.1.3: Well, now it's HOPT (thanks, "preceding"!) since the control-1 limit was streamlined away - also you no longer need to control exactly the matching Toa Nuva, basically sacrificing a little lore accuracy for more deckbuilding and gameplay options
		=> Mandatory "leaves the field" trigger that negates the matching Toa Nuva and inflicts some drawback opposed to the bonus from the previous effect
		==> 4.0.2: Let's see if a mandatory -1 is too much of a drawback, would be the logical opposition to draw 1 after all
		==> 4.1.3: No longer need the exact Toa Nuva to gain the benefit, so therefore the punish can now hit all of them as well (also this way there's no edge case with Toa Nuva in the S/T zone)

		{{Place "Nuva" Continuous Spell from Deck}}
		
		Effect structure for Nuva Kanohi:
		=> If sent to GY, search an EP card (HOPT)
		==> this way, even bricking on Nuva Symbols and Kanohi will net you the fusion materials for a Toa Nuva
		==> this is the first thing we'd drop if we need to save words
		==> 4.0.1: instead keep the original banish cost (to show the connection between the two Pakaris), but as payoff place a Nuva Symbol - that can then do the searching
		===> maybe it should be Deep Wisdom specifically, to keep the connection between Onua and his mask?
		===> allows using a Toa Nuva's search and discard to get a Nuva Symbol on the field even with an empty hand, so that's a nice benefit of running both Symbols and Kanohi
		=> Two effects while equipped to a Toa Nuva
		==> one that (usually passively) affects the wearer only
		==> one that can be (SOPT) activated to grant a lesser version of the power to your whole field for a time
		
		Due to technical limitations, we can't support "Toa Nuva", so let's go for "Nuva" Fusions instead
		=> might become a problem with the Nuva Kaita (and later Phantoka/Mistika), though...
		==> if we just demand "Nuva" monsters in general, it would also work with Takanuva, so that's wrong (also "Nuva" Fusion Monsters might be a problem in its own right regarding Takutanuva)
		=> perhaps the only future-proof solution is making "Toa Nuva" a separate archetype after all, and then just never make support for "Nuva" monsters to keep things simple

		Maybe also "Reveal 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck that mentions that target as material", so it's restricted to those Fusions that specifically name their non-EP material?
		=> does kinda fit with the whole "Destiny" vibe
		
		Unfortunately, effect #2 might be completely unimplementable due to the need of checking which fusions are summonable with materials that include a hypothetical token that does not exist until the effect resolves ...
		=> Alternative A: Special Summon the Token and allow an optional Fusion Summon afterwards, so no checks need to be done until the Token actually exists on the field
		==> Downside 1: Can just leave the Token around to use it for other stuff
		==> Downside 2: The target not interacting with the EP at all is against the card's theme
		==> Downside 3: An effect like Branded in Red would be hard to include logicstically in something that already is a bullet point of its own
		=> Alternative B: Reveal a Fusion Monster, Special Summon an EP monster from Deck, then either use the target as material for the revealed monster or send it to the GY
		==> Perhaps an even better representation of Destiny because you find out at resolution whether the target will be transformed or destroyed
		==> Downside 1: We don't get to use the Token :(
		==> Downside 2: Triggering the on-fusion effect of EP Chamber this easily is probably broken
		===> Solution 1: Make EP Chamber only fire when used as material by a non-EP effect, not just anything but itself
		===> Solution 2: Put the summoned monster back into the deck or banish it face-down or something when it leaves the field (again, tricky to include in wording)
		==> Downside 3: Always vulnerable to Ash Blossom this way
		==> Alternative C: Special Summon the Token, then either send both Token and target to SS EP monster from Deck, or fuse Token and target.
		===> Extremely on-theme - what cannot be fused dies simply because those are the only two options
		===> Sort of combines A and B, you still get to use the Token, but the ability to fuse with it must not be checked before it exists
		====> ... except we would need to check for activation legality in case no EP monster is in Deck
		====> could just make the SS from Deck optional, then activation is legal as long as we can make the Token
		===> Downside 1: Pretty convoluted, we're basically making a Token that serves no purpose in the non-fusing case.
		===> Downside 2: Tokens can't be sent to the GY successfully, so non-fusing case would need to either do something else (e.g. tribute) or use some kind of "also" conjuction/change the order of operations
		===> Downside 3: If there is no EP monster that can be summoned from Deck, the effect is only legal to activate if we are able to fuse, which brings us back to the original issue.
		====> Solution 1: Make the SS from Deck optional (awkward!)
		====> Solution 2: Using an "also" conjunction might make it so we don't need to SS for a legal activation
		====> Actually, it seems like Springans Interluder works as long as the "preliminary" action of returning an Xyz is possible, so maybe the options don't need to be fully resolvable anyway?

		=> Merge AoE with floating effect, as a bonus you get while you have a Toa Nuva

		Variant A:
		"If a "Nuva" Fusion Monster you control activates its effect: You can return 1 card your opponent controls to the hand."
		=> Unrestricted, non-targeting bounce to supplement Lewa
		=> unfortunately only really doable in a boring way because the effect won't trigger until after the Toa Nuva effect has resolved
		=> If Lewa bounced 1 card on each side of the field, the floating thing from Frigid Serenity would actually fit really well here because it would work even if Lewa goes back to ED
		
		Variant B:
		" If a "Nuva" Fusion Monster you control leaves the field: You can target 1 of your Level 8 or lower monsters that is banished or in the GY; Special Summon it."
		=> the floating effect to match double-bounce Lewa
		=> being able to get any monster up to Lv8 means you can summon back a Toa Nuva or Toa Mata, but also an EP Chamber to make a new fusion
		==> but could also get something like Scythe, which sounds a bit cancerous when you can trigger it yourself (but if you couldn't, the Lewa play wouldn't work ...)

		Helps your Nuva Symbols dodge removal effects without triggering their drawbacks
		
		Once it has touched six symbols, "unseal the Bahrag" with a generic SS
		=> probably too powerful for that condition though
		
		It would be nice if it could also somehow replace the dodged symbols, but where to find the space for that?
		=> maybe if shuffling back directly does various effects
		=> Problem: Shuffling from GY is necessary to ever have 6 at once and to align with symbol theft mechanics, but the cost of shuffling something from field and shuffling something from GY is way different
		==> case in point: shuffling back a Nuva Symbol on the field to get one from the Deck swaps effects at best, shuffling back one in the GY gives you a fresh Nuva Symbol and goes +1
		==> we could be super cute here and make it "your field or your opponent's GY", so the only way to get 6 symbols is in a mirror match or by using the Nuva Cube alone against a Toa Nuva deck - very lore appropriate
		===> careful - 1+ can only resolve if a Nuva Symbol is in your own deck ... unless it's optional like Wavering Eyes
		===> in general, having mandatory effects that can't always resolve would likely mean you may not freely be able to shuffle back a certain number and thus fail to protect your symbols in some cases, so try to design around that
		====> can be avoided by making it like Kowloon and having all the effects be optional by default, but that means the shuffle must be part of the effect or else it would be possible to "do nothing"
		=> Also watch out for Ashable effect components in the optional things, wouldn't want a life-saving shuffle to be negated just because it could theoretically add something to hand
