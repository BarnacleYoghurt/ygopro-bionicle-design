		SS from hand going 2nd so the NS remains usable for something else
		Fuse by dumping a monster from your hand into the Pool
		If forcibly used as material by another fusion effect, that transformation goes against Destiny, and so the Energized Protodermis will exhibit destructive properties (but not necessarily aimed at the summoned monster)
		=> might be good to restrict this to Special Summoned monsters only, so it's a bit more of a drawback
		
		Has to be a Tube (TODO: Better word?) because the monster "descends" into it like the Toa Mata after the Bahrag (and it happens suddenly on summon, too)
		=> Would Pool then be something involving multiple monsters at once (i.e. Takutanuva)?
		=> Technically, going by the novel version, the tubes do lead into a pool ... but in the comic, the EP is directly inside the tubes instead, and this is still during the Hapka books so the comics might actually be more canon in this case
		==> Comic uses the word "chamber" at one point, we can probably go with that

		Magnetize target monster to prevent it from attacking (see: Gahlok-Kal vs Lewa), can also take out another monster by making it "stick" to the target (see: Pohatu and the Mahi)
		=> stealthy non-targeting removal, befitting of Gahlok-Kal's ability to solve all kinds of problems
		==> would kinda like it to work on S/T too, but the mechanics of turning those into equips seem a bit problematic
		=> may be too strong for 1 mat, but is 2 mat worth it when it's not even quick (and quick would be a bit OP...)?
		==> limiting the timing to start of BP may be a reasonable extra condition
		==> if equipping anything from the field is too powerful after all, a stylish way to nerf it would be only equipping monsters in the same or an adjacent column (see Scareclaws for wording) - limiting the range of the magnets
		===> wording is quite tricky (if we follow the Scareclaw precedent and only take adjacent, not adjacent column) - double "to it"!

		Effect structure for Nuva Symbols:
		=> Can only control 1 each
		==> mostly so soft OPT won't get too out of control
		==> 4.1.3: We need to simplify, so let's drop this and use HOPT instead
		=> HOPT place self on bottom of Deck to search matching Toa Mata
		==> Lets the Nuva Symbol act as additional copies
		==> Returning to deck offsets the plus, avoids triggering "leaves the field"
		==> Maybe there's some other reasonable target rather than just the one Toa specifically (which also overlaps with Mata Kanohi)?
		===> 4.0.1: We now search both the matching Toa Mata and EP cards, so we can always grab the missing component
		=> Soft OPT granting some significant bonus to all Toa Nuva while you control the matching one
		==> 4.0.2: LP gain didn't seem significant enough, so now we instead have basically Heatsoul, which is free (and can potentially add any card from GY) if combined with Onua's effect
		===> arguably we could drop the OPT since we have a LP cost and all the Nuva effects are HOPT (so it wouldn't be crazier than, say, Hyper Librarian), but that seems a bit too much and also gets weird with triggers off multiple effects in the same chain
		==> 4.1.3: Well, now it's HOPT (thanks, "preceding"!) since the control-1 limit was streamlined away - also you no longer need to control exactly the matching Toa Nuva, basically sacrificing a little lore accuracy for more deckbuilding and gameplay options
		=> Mandatory "leaves the field" trigger that negates the matching Toa Nuva and inflicts some drawback opposed to the bonus from the previous effect
		==> 4.0.2: Let's see if a mandatory -1 is too much of a drawback, would be the logical opposition to draw 1 after all
		==> 4.1.3: No longer need the exact Toa Nuva to gain the benefit, so therefore the punish can now hit all of them as well (also this way there's no edge case with Toa Nuva in the S/T zone)

		{{Place "Nuva" Continuous Spell from Deck}}
		
		Effect structure for Nuva Kanohi:
		=> If sent to GY, search an EP card (HOPT)
		==> this way, even bricking on Nuva Symbols and Kanohi will net you the fusion materials for a Toa Nuva
		==> this is the first thing we'd drop if we need to save words
		==> 4.0.1: instead keep the original banish cost (to show the connection between the two Pakaris), but as payoff place a Nuva Symbol - that can then do the searching
		===> maybe it should be Deep Wisdom specifically, to keep the connection between Onua and his mask?
		===> allows using a Toa Nuva's search and discard to get a Nuva Symbol on the field even with an empty hand, so that's a nice benefit of running both Symbols and Kanohi
		=> Two effects while equipped to a Toa Nuva
		==> one that (usually passively) affects the wearer only
		==> one that can be (SOPT) activated to grant a lesser version of the power to your whole field for a time
		
		Due to technical limitations, we can't support "Toa Nuva", so let's go for "Nuva" Fusions instead
		=> might become a problem with the Nuva Kaita (and later Phantoka/Mistika), though...
		==> if we just demand "Nuva" monsters in general, it would also work with Takanuva, so that's wrong (also "Nuva" Fusion Monsters might be a problem in its own right regarding Takutanuva)
		=> perhaps the only future-proof solution is making "Toa Nuva" a separate archetype after all, and then just never make support for "Nuva" monsters to keep things simple

		Regular Ja stopped effects of everything currently visible during the next turn - this one is more targeted (because it "tracks"), but takes effect immediately and can also stop threats that are not currently visible (by "sniffing them out")
		=> v4.3.2: Detaching for bonus effect cost is kinda confusing and annoying, so to fix that and bring this more in line with base Ja it's now been nerfed to protection rather than a lingering floodgate - more healthy anyway
		
		v4.3.2: Also allow SS face-down, so you can e.g. get a Strategy search and still try to turn on the flip engine
		=> what's the ruling for leave-field redirects on face-downs?
		==> Galaxy Mirror Sage offers precedent, but has no explicit ruling - guess we just follow that script and assume whatever RESETS_REDIRECT does is right

		{{Send target to GY}}
		{{Fusion Summon}}
		{{Special Summon from Deck?}}
		
		Maybe also "Reveal 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck that mentions that target as material", so it's restricted to those Fusions that specifically name their non-EP material?
		=> does kinda fit with the whole "Destiny" vibe
		
		Unfortunately, effect #2 might be completely unimplementable due to the need of checking which fusions are summonable with materials that include a hypothetical token that does not exist until the effect resolves ...
		=> Alternative A: Special Summon the Token and allow an optional Fusion Summon afterwards, so no checks need to be done until the Token actually exists on the field
		==> Downside 1: Can just leave the Token around to use it for other stuff
		==> Downside 2: The target not interacting with the EP at all is against the card's theme
		==> Downside 3: An effect like Branded in Red would be hard to include logicstically in something that already is a bullet point of its own
		=> Alternative B: Reveal a Fusion Monster, Special Summon an EP monster from Deck, then either use the target as material for the revealed monster or send it to the GY
		==> Perhaps an even better representation of Destiny because you find out at resolution whether the target will be transformed or destroyed
		==> Downside 1: We don't get to use the Token :(
		==> Downside 2: Triggering the on-fusion effect of EP Chamber this easily is probably broken
		===> Solution 1: Make EP Chamber only fire when used as material by a non-EP effect, not just anything but itself
		===> Solution 2: Put the summoned monster back into the deck or banish it face-down or something when it leaves the field (again, tricky to include in wording)
		==> Downside 3: Always vulnerable to Ash Blossom this way
		==> Alternative C: Special Summon the Token, then either send both Token and target to SS EP monster from Deck, or fuse Token and target.
		===> Extremely on-theme - what cannot be fused dies simply because those are the only two options
		===> Sort of combines A and B, you still get to use the Token, but the ability to fuse with it must not be checked before it exists
		====> ... except we would need to check for activation legality in case no EP monster is in Deck
		====> could just make the SS from Deck optional, then activation is legal as long as we can make the Token
		===> Downside 1: Pretty convoluted, we're basically making a Token that serves no purpose in the non-fusing case.
		===> Downside 2: Tokens can't be sent to the GY successfully, so non-fusing case would need to either do something else (e.g. tribute) or use some kind of "also" conjuction/change the order of operations
		===> Downside 3: If there is no EP monster that can be summoned from Deck, the effect is only legal to activate if we are able to fuse, which brings us back to the original issue.
		====> Solution 1: Make the SS from Deck optional (awkward!)
		====> Solution 2: Using an "also" conjunction might make it so we don't need to SS for a legal activation
		====> Actually, it seems like Springans Interluder works as long as the "preliminary" action of returning an Xyz is possible, so maybe the options don't need to be fully resolvable anyway?

		Variant A:
		"If a "Nuva" Fusion Monster you control activates its effect: You can return 1 card your opponent controls to the hand."
		=> Unrestricted, non-targeting bounce to supplement Lewa
		=> unfortunately only really doable in a boring way because the effect won't trigger until after the Toa Nuva effect has resolved
		=> If Lewa bounced 1 card on each side of the field, the floating thing from Frigid Serenity would actually fit really well here because it would work even if Lewa goes back to ED
		
		Variant B:
		" If a "Nuva" Fusion Monster you control leaves the field: You can target 1 of your Level 8 or lower monsters that is banished or in the GY; Special Summon it."
		=> the floating effect to match double-bounce Lewa
		=> being able to get any monster up to Lv8 means you can summon back a Toa Nuva or Toa Mata, but also an EP Chamber to make a new fusion
		==> but could also get something like Scythe, which sounds a bit cancerous when you can trigger it yourself (but if you couldn't, the Lewa play wouldn't work ...)
		=> v4.2.4: Being able to freely bring back banished monsters as well makes it a bit too easy to play fast and loose with Kanohi costs, and if we absolutely needed to summon from banished, Quest for the Masks and Nuva Cube (the later more in theory) do provide ways to do that
		==> also it hasn't come up in testing and it probably won't hurt to cut this text down a bit

		Helps your Nuva Symbols dodge removal effects without triggering their drawbacks
		
		Once it has touched six symbols, "unseal the Bahrag" with a generic SS
		=> probably too powerful for that condition though
		
		It would be nice if it could also somehow replace the dodged symbols, but where to find the space for that?
		=> maybe if shuffling back directly does various effects
		=> Problem: Shuffling from GY is necessary to ever have 6 at once and to align with symbol theft mechanics, but the cost of shuffling something from field and shuffling something from GY is way different
		==> case in point: shuffling back a Nuva Symbol on the field to get one from the Deck swaps effects at best, shuffling back one in the GY gives you a fresh Nuva Symbol and goes +1
		==> we could be super cute here and make it "your field or your opponent's GY", so the only way to get 6 symbols is in a mirror match or by using the Nuva Cube alone against a Toa Nuva deck - very lore appropriate
		===> careful - 1+ can only resolve if a Nuva Symbol is in your own deck ... unless it's optional like Wavering Eyes
		===> in general, having mandatory effects that can't always resolve would likely mean you may not freely be able to shuffle back a certain number and thus fail to protect your symbols in some cases, so try to design around that
		====> can be avoided by making it like Kowloon and having all the effects be optional by default, but that means the shuffle must be part of the effect or else it would be possible to "do nothing"
		==> upon further reflection, getting Nuva Symbols into your own GY is generally so bad for you that a way to turn that into a benefit doesn't sound totally unfair, so why not go with "either GY" after all?
		=> Also watch out for Ashable effect components in the optional things, wouldn't want a life-saving shuffle to be negated just because it could theoretically add something to hand

		Defensive effect enhanced to also include effect targeting protection and allow a complete lock with multiple copies, but also adding the offensive effect would probably take up too much space ...
		=> couple issues with this design: only having protection in defense makes it feel annoyingly risky to switch to attack on your turn, and the lack of a repeatable activated effect limits synergy with Nuva Symbols like Harmony and Wisdom
		==> arguably the former is fair considering how broad the protection is, and the latter is just a tradeoff for having the Nuva Symbols themselves protected
		==> maybe having effect protection in attack pos and attack protection in defense pos would help? But then you'd have unprotected Nuva Symbols during your opponent's MP1 usually ... (also we don't want to make this any more wordy)
		==> different idea: generic protection in defense, and offensive (banishing) quick effect regardless of position while you control no other monsters
		===> lets Kopaka do something while working alone as he prefers
		===> proactive retrain of Kopaka Mata's banishing (freezing) effect fits Nuva design pattern
		===> "no other monsters" restriction means you still have some tradeoff of Nuva Symbol synergy vs protection
		===> not too long assuming we sacrifice the battle position change, which you probably don't need when you can summon in defense anyway
		====> now if we also tossed the HOPT on the search effect, we could even cut that entire clause here as well by just making the banish soft once per turn/once while face-up ...

		Potential buff to compensate for relatively niche S/T removal: SS a Rock "Fragment Token" (under certain conditions?) to natively build up more pops and trigger Granite Tenacity
		=> "if your opponent controls more monsters than you do" - simple, limits it to a catchup mechanic in terms of monster count, but somewhat infringes on Matau's copyright
		=> "if you destroyed a face-up card(s)" - makes some sense with how the continuous ones would be the ones to leave fragments, rewards popping cards that were already chained in response, but it's a bit weird how you also get the bonus for randomly popping Normal S/T while they resolve

		Letting everything attack directly feels way too busted ...
		=> but also something like a half-damage clause takes up too much space
		=> maybe "the monster(s) you currently control with the lowest ATK"?
		==> bit arbitrary though
		=> some fixed burn per monster could be representative, but feels a bit FTK-ish
		=> could do an actual ATK reduction (optional!), that's shorter and also does the trick
		==> if the ATK reduction is during damage calculation when attacking directly, it's still shorter and still optional without additional hoops to jump through
		==> even has precedent in the form of Cyberdark Edge (and Dark Artist lmao)
		==> probably the most fitting way to have the monsters "phase" through and hit while not entirely solid

		First just disable opponent's monsters (ATK reduction) with a stasis field, then blow up the weaker ones
		=> affects the whole field as a Raigeki reference
		=> quick effect and only face-up as a Tahnok reference
		=> require second material detach for boardwipe so it's not as easily reusable
		=> a mere 500 reduction doesn't seem hindering enough to represent a Tahnok-Kal forcefield ...
		==> v4.3.2: Just lock down the whole monster for the turn, Kohrak-Kal can do something slightly different instead
		===> it would be nice to have some kind of filter for the destruction like only the monsters weaker than the initial target (or "not stronger", for more range), but that extra clause might add too much length ...
		===> Quick Raigeki still feels kinda busted compared to what's available IRL, so maybe we should hard limit it to 2000 ATK (i.e. the sub-Toa range)
		===> having an attack lock also feels a bit redundant with Gahlok, but the overall effects are different enough, so let's keep it for now

		Alternatively: ..., then choose that many Main Monster Zones and/or Spell & Trap Zones on the field; return as many cards in those zones to the hand as possible, also those unused zones cannot be used until your next Standby Phase.
		=> float stuff in selected zones back to hand, and also Ground Collapse them into unusability (like base Nuhvok)
		=> phrasing: should make the zones unusable even if it didn't bounce anything, but only those that actually do end up empty
		=> unfortunately we don't really have any representation of the scene with Matoro getting supergravity'd this way
		=> v4.3.1: Upon further inspection, this is kind of better non-targeting removal than Gahlok-Kal, so some downside is warranted - let's see if requiring a detach of 2+ is enough (since that way the Krana-Kal attaching can't keep up)

		=> if you banish the monster you're battling at the start of the damage step, the attack won't count for Zeus

		==> maybe a timing like "during the battle phase, if an attack was declared involving this card this turn (quick effect):"

		Stun opponent's entire field with a massive sound blast

		=> should this maybe affect your field as well (since that is a canon downside of Kohrak-Kal's powers)?
		==> why yes it should
		=> actually might be one of those effects that can and should get away without an OPT
		==> chaining it to itself accomplishes nothing extra and is limited by material count
		==> chaining it after your opponent responded to the first activation (if you have enough material) is a legitimately useful expansion of the card's capabilities
		==> doesn't push you towards making multiple copies because they would just negate each other anyway
		
		It might make sense to also have a "monsters on the field cannot activate their effects in response to this effect's activation"
		=> makes it proactively usable vs quick effects (such as the Toa Nuva) and also strong going second into a board of monsters
		==> however, the Bohrok-Kal don't really need to have an advantage against Toa Nuva with their effects intact, they fight them "negated" anyway
		=> also enhances the drawback since you can't just chain your own quickies before they get negated
		=> still not totally oppressive because anything that's not a monster effect on the field can beat it anyway
		=> would need to be coupled with something like "this card cannot attack for the rest of this turn", otherwise you can just go and make Zeus from that position

		Wipe backrow with an air blast (see also: HFD) and suck up a card to set up the next one
		=> lets you dodge Waking the Dragon by attaching it mid-resolution before it triggers
		=> technically doing this in the wrong order, but the Krana succ kind of is already the prior setup in that sense
		=> too better than Tornado Dragon?
		==> Updated version technically has the same cost per pop, with the advantages of doing multiple at once and also having the attach option
		
		Updated: Separate the sucking and blowing into two distinct options, like inhaling and exhaling
		=> Now hits two areas the other Kal don't particularly cover - GY and backrow - to make up for not doing anything to monsters
		=> Ideally it would be nice to keep the spirit of the WtD dodge by shuffling the cards back instead of destroying them, but that's more words in an already long text
		==> Also this way the inhale/exhale is actually symmetric - one effect steals stuff from GY and the other tries to put it there
		==> On the other hand, a shuffle would ensure Lehvak-Kal can't just banallly trigger Nuva Symbols' negative effects without using Strategy ...
		===> Nuhvok-Kal can do that anyway, so that ship has sailed methinks
		
		Updated for better streamlining: By letting the S U C C effect work on your field or either GY, it can also replace the Krana-attaching effect and leave more room for the air blast part of the effect.
		=> Using that room, we have reintroduced the idea of sucking up a destroyed card, made it a detach all (but only at resolution so Za-Kal remains just long enough to negate a negate), and traded out quick effect status for the ability to hit any card.
		==> That last point is nice because it was the base Lehvak's whole thing! 
		=> maybe too much versatility here, so we could restrict the detach effect a bit by only letting it work from e.g. 4+ materials
		==> Enough that you usually can't do it the turn you summon Lehvak-Kal, but if it lives for a turn you get there
		==> By not being able to just detach 1 or 2, the refill from immediately attaching 1 again doesn't make this such a constanct menace
		==> Could even upgrade to hit more than 1 card per material, but Number 91's 5 materials to destroy all cards (with no native attach effect) should remain unpowercreeped

		Yet another option: Literally "seek out" the Bahrag by providing another way to banish them from ED or GY as setup for Xa-Kal
		=> it's just that the lore implications don't line up when the banishing is supposed to be their defeat

		Plain and simple, just dig through the ground for direct attacks
		=> not damage-limited like base Yo because that limitation was maybe always too strict
		=> what about sensing stress points and underground movement?
		==> the latter is nicely represented by blocking responses in battle, which also has convenient synergy with Pahrak-Kal

		==> Option A: Just look at 1 random card
		===> or maybe as many random cards as you control Bohrok (Xyz)?
		===> or make it dependent on the number of materials
		==> Option B: Look at hand with more restrictive timing, e.g. Standby Phase
		==> Let's try A first, because it works in one bullet point and thus looks nicer in the text box

		{{Activate by banishing Bahrag}}

		Launch the Kal while simultaneously setting up the banished Bahrag situation so they actually have a mission to fulfill
		=> currently overlaps with south-pointing Krana-Kal, but maybe if those need to do something less verbose anyway, this can fill the gap
		=> revised approach: completely cheat out the Kal (but not as an Xyz Summon) with materials from GY, at the cost of sending another archetypal card so it doesn't plus as hard
		==> notably, the cost can be itself, so you can get this for free if you don't care about repeatability
		===> could even be used as a benefit since that way MST won't negate it
		==> or you can send off Krana-Kal that got stuck in the EMZ because your initial Kal-making plans were stopped
		==> by attaching any "Bohrok" monster, not just Level 4s, the Kal themselves can be recycled via this effect
		==> could also have another component ", then, if a "Bohrok" monster left the field by your opponent's card this turn, you can destroy 1 card your opponent controls" so it acts as disruption by itself (with a thematic condition) but 
		===> a) I can't actually find any precedent for "left the field ... this turn" and 
		===> b) that would be cutting it really close with the word count
		=> just banishing Bahrag may be too light a turbo cost, considering you only really need to turbo once a duel anyway and certain Krana-Kal benefit from it
		==> interesting additional condition: "If your opponent controls a card"
		===> Works going second
		===> but also when you need to dodge an Imperm real quick!
		===> maybe make that face-up card?
		=> might also be good to send off/put back the summoned monster after X period time so you can't get too ridiculously ahead while winning
		==> not currently doing that because it takes up too many words and it doesn't really matter how hard you win anyway
		
		Not so sure about this name

	rule text: If your opponent controls a face-up card, you can activate this card the turn it was Set, by banishing 2 "Bahrag" monsters with different names from your Extra Deck. During the Main Phase: You can send 1 "Bohrok" or "Krana" card from your hand or face-up field to the GY, then target up to 2 "Bohrok" monsters in your GY; Special Summon 1 "Bohrok" Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck, and if you do, attach the targeted monster(s) to it as material. You can only use this effect of "Bohrok Kalifornication" once per turn.
	gamecode: 10100345
card:
	has styling: false
	notes:
		Usage A (Lore): Make the Bohrok-Kal impervious to outside harm in "the final moments" before their triumph
		=> implied condition #1: Must be in the said final moments
		==> Timing at start of BP, since Xa-Kal also triggers in battle?
		===> Could also be in your SP if you control a monster that qualifies, since that still means you're about to make your move 
		==> Require banished Bahrag, to have the scene set properly?
		=> implied condition #2: Bohrok-Kal with Krana-Kal, as the Krana-Kal is what turns silver
		=> How far should the protection go? Just effects or also tributing, fusing, etc?
		==> Should Silver Shield itself be SS4?
		=> If Silver Krana-Kal ends up being a monster of its own, that would also need to be involved in this effect somehow
		
		Usage B (Utility): Additional way to attach Krana, in case the OPT on each Bohrok-Kal isn't enough
		=> Also lets you do it without running into monster negates
		
		Which one of these should be the main and which one the GY effect?
		=> Advantage of Lore as GY effect: Not reliant on having the card Set at just the moment when it can actually be used
		==> Since that effect is most likely a trigger effect, this version could also realistically be done as a Spell (Quick-Play or Normal), allowing more immediate access to the utility part
		=> Advantage of Utiltiy as GY effect: Can do it without a turn of setup, which is useful w.r. to the aforementioned avoiding of monster negates
		==> Also would be the proper priority considering the protections from Silver is what the card is about
