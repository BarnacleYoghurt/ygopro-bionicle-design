		Idea for V2:
		Since Rahi's GY focus is due to being controlled by Makuta, maybe make him help unite their nature as pendulum monsters with that (e.g. sending Rahi from ED to GY). Also, it might make sense to reduce the GY focus on Rahi in general a bit and only leave it on those with some sort of special Makuta connection, so there's a reference point for Rahi in their natural environment.
		=> The big ones that were Makuta's main force in 2001 could also have GY-related Pendulum Effects
		=> OTOH: All Rahi have a Makuta connection since they're made by them, and GY effects on pendulums are just a play on GY effects on Spells

		Alt. (to match Maku):
		Can attack your opponent directly if the do not contral a monster in this card's column. If your opponent does not control a monster in this card's column: You can activate this effect; this card gains 500 ATK.
		=> Activating effect is sure to trigger Maku's revival
		=> Both ATK gain and direct attack benefit are negated by summoning Maku - they just hang out instead
		=> rough outline, not very useful, but coordinate with Maku to make sure the connection works
		=> maybe make Maku reset ATK gain entirely instead - less universally useful, but would allow for the above v2 Eff
		=> actually Maku making all monsters lose ATK already matches with v2 Eff. Scenario: Activate Huki to gain x1+x2+x3+x4 ATK -> Chain Maku -> Maku is summoned, makes all opponent's monsters lose 500 ATK -> ATK change for Huki is now (x1-500+x2-500+x3-500+x4-500)-500=(x1+x2+x3+x4)-2500 (assuming, of course, all x>=500)
		=> only works if Maku can activate in Damage Step!
		=> now Maku switches to Defense Position, so ATK gain can be however high and still be effectively neutralized
