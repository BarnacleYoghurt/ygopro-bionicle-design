		==> synergy with Muaka is that you'd have the Muaka destroy something else to fuel its effect, which also represents the way the Kane-Ra's horns keep it safe

		Idea for V2:
		Since Rahi's GY focus is due to being controlled by Makuta, maybe make him help unite their nature as pendulum monsters with that (e.g. sending Rahi from ED to GY). Also, it might make sense to reduce the GY focus on Rahi in general a bit and only leave it on those with some sort of special Makuta connection, so there's a reference point for Rahi in their natural environment.
		=> The big ones that were Makuta's main force in 2001 could also have GY-related Pendulum Effects
		=> OTOH: All Rahi have a Makuta connection since they're made by them, and GY effects on pendulums are just a play on GY effects on Spells
		=> actual changes:
		==> Mandatory Ritual Summon removed
		==> On-Summon adjusted to new official Toa starline, but only Special Summoned so the regular ones can theoretically actually have their final boss fight
		==> in a perfectly on-theme world, it would be ED monsters, but then we don't get to have fun with Kaijus
		==> self-Tribute now adds any Rahi card (so it's another S/T searcher) and then summons potentially anything from hand, which gives us a bunch of cool side utility
		===> s/self-Tribute/DARK Tribute/ - for Lair synergy!

		"Slow and harmless" - after the opponent does something, it slowpoke activates and trades itself for something less harmless
		=> it flies, so targeting protection as bonus
		==> making it WIND for the same reason is kinda cute because it gives us Waikiru access with the Taketomborg we might already play for Hikaki
		=> does not have the double-banish cost even from hand because being purely reactive and delayed is already a real drawback, so no need to use up resources we need for a Ruki or Makuta Fish just to get them out
		==> can now also summon itself, so you can effectively get it from hand to field and turn on the protection this way

		A surprise Rahi pops out and eats whatever just moved
		=> also the Drifts do not affect it
		==> actually might not need the effect restriction to have that flavor - the ATK and destruction check happens before the Drifts apply, so the main job has already been done!
		=> best to just get a big guy for the pop, as on-summon effects won't work anyway
		=> could also negate responses to Synchro effects from the GY, that fits the theme
		==> or a temp banish as an alternate way to dodge Drifts and preserver the monster until next turn - disappearing back into the snow
		===> since it gets returned and not Special Summoned, Drifts wouldn't trigger again
		===> can be used as a way to get banish effects as well
		===> does make Beast Synchros lose their gained effects, so that's a bit unfortunate given the imagery
		=> Wording is noticeably nicer (due to not repeating "that opponent's monster") if we just make it an optional destruction of anything small enough

		v3.20.2: Updated to not just be a crazy spammable searcher
		=> Destruction protection for other Matoran is still there since it goes well with the assistant role
		=> QE burn represents doing mundane chores (i.e., contributing just slightly to the process of getting the opponent to 0) and basically gives an easy +1 chain link in any situation while serving as an easy way to trigger Nixie
		=> Trigger effect from GY when another Ga-Matoran is sent there again follows the assistant concept, and in practical terms lets us chain block or Ga-Koro protect any effects that trigger off Nokama's discard
		==> current payoff is self-SS since the original effect had that too, but maybe it would be better to adapt the search part with a self-banish cost instead?
		==> Banishing during EP (or self-banish as cost) is to set up recovery by Nokama, referencing Hahli being personally selected by her in MNOG2

		v3.20.2: Finetuned and extended to make a bit of a recursive combo with Onu-Koro, Midak, and Ussal
		=> Putting Onepu on the field fulfills the condition for Midak in hand
		=> Midak discards himself to send Ussal, Ussal brings back Midak, Onepu brings back Ussal
		=> Use the 3 monsters for whatever, shuffle the two Matoran in GY back with Onu-Koro (Midak goes to hand!)
		=> next turn if we can find Onepu again, we can NS him and put Ussal back in Deck with Midak already in hand, thus resetting the combo
		=> draw with potential LP gain is a bonus that basically roleplays Onepu bragging about his accomplishments of the previous turn to whatever fellow Matoran happens to be around, giving himself a big "reward" (in Onu-Koro terms) while doing so
		==> a bit unfortunate to have the rare draw & show mechanic overlap with Nixie, but eh

		{{Gain ATK}}
		
		v2 Eff (to replace current 2nd and 3rd):
		Once per turn, at the start of the Damage Step: You can have this card gain ATK equal to the combined ATK of all other "Matoran" monsters you control, until the end of this turn.
		Alt. (to match Maku):
		Can attack your opponent directly if the do not contral a monster in this card's column. If your opponent does not control a monster in this card's column: You can activate this effect; this card gains 500 ATK.
		=> Activating effect is sure to trigger Maku's revival
		=> Both ATK gain and direct attack benefit are negated by summoning Maku - they just hang out instead
		=> rough outline, not very useful, but coordinate with Maku to make sure the connection works
		=> maybe make Maku reset ATK gain entirely instead - less universally useful, but would allow for the above v2 Eff
		=> actually Maku making all monsters lose ATK already matches with v2 Eff. Scenario: Activate Huki to gain x1+x2+x3+x4 ATK -> Chain Maku -> Maku is summoned, makes all opponent's monsters lose 500 ATK -> ATK change for Huki is now (x1-500+x2-500+x3-500+x4-500)-500=(x1+x2+x3+x4)-2500 (assuming, of course, all x>=500)
		=> only works if Maku can activate in Damage Step!
		=> now Maku switches to Defense Position, so ATK gain can be however high and still be effectively neutralized
		=> v3.20.2: Split up - 1) SS to empty column sets up the Maku counter and helps Po-Koro combos by potentially triggering Onewa 2) buff arbitrarily high depening on an opponent's monster, but in the same column as a Matoran so you can't generically use the SS and buff together
		==> 1) might still be too universally good as an extender, maybe give it another requirement
		==> if it only counts monsters it's definitely safe since there's precedent (Abyss Actor Extras), also rephrased as a summoning procedure like Red Hared Hasty Horse
		===> also specifies attack position now because that goes well with the Koli roleplay

		{{Banished by "Red Star of Prophecies"}}
		... this isn't displayed while banished, but let's put it here just in case
		
		Concept: Middle point between anime and game Gold Sarc, lets you set up a "prophecy" of a card and negate it if it comes to pass, but also banishes face-up so the rare S/T that likes to be banished can benefit.
		... such as all the other Red Star cards that do stuff like add themselves to your hand if banished :)
		> Red Star of Ignition (Inika)
		> Red Star of Propulsion (Jetpack)
		> Red Star of Reincarnation (Zombie Space Station)
		
		... and also Kashtira and Swordsoul, oops. Maybe not the best idea after all.
		=> could easily counteract those by making the negate mandatory on all effects with the same name, but then the archetype also doesn't work
		==> unless it's a continuous "if this card would be banished by a "Red Star" card's effect, add it to your hand instead"!
		==> or just has "this effect cannot be negated" on the self-add, the "and if you do" would then make it so Prophecy just stays in the GY
		
		Last-Minute rename to "Prophecies" because "Prophecy" (with the "of" even!) is technically an archetype
		=> also makes sense because banishing multiple with this does stack
