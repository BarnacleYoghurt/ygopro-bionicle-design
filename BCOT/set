		{{FAIYAAAAAAAAAAAH!}}
		
		Already has overhaul effects.
		
		Further overhaul should do the following:
		-) Feasible boss monster for Ta-Koro deck
		-) Feasible part of a multi-Toa deck (Kaita or even all six)
		-) Depict the process of being lost in the ocean for a long time before finally coming to rescue the Matoran somehow (e.g. SS condition that requires (FIRE) monsters in your GY and opponent to control monsters)
		
		General Toa Mata effect structure:
		1) Allow Tributes from hand (maybe with some restriction like not attacking the turn it's summoned like that?)
		2) Effect supporting the Koro's playstyle
		3) Kanohi cycling
		
		For Tahu, 2) does ATK reduction to help with battle. Could also be a continuous effect, or only trigger on own summon (but be more powerful), or do burn damage when a FIRE monster destroys a monster by battle, or do something on attack declaration (could be safely activated in combination with Hau, since Tahu can then just attack whatever) ...
		Maybe: "Once per turn, when a monster you control gains ATK: You can make all monsters your opponent controls lose the same amount of ATK." Downside: Doesn't activate on own summon.
		
		Alt 2): Once per turn, before damage calculation: ... (more flexible)
		
		
		Problem with fancy new Kanohi equipping effect: Link Isolde, send 6 Kanohi, Special Summon Toa --> any 2 Warriors equal a nearly free Toa Mata able to cycle through the full ass of protection and buffs
		=> too easy, especially since the key card is entirely unrelated to the archetype
		=> on the other hand, running 6 different Kanohi is a gimmick deck anyway, so maybe Isolde enabling that isn't too bad
		=> but Golden Kanohi should definitely be changed
		
		Usability issue with swap effect returning Kanohi: Since each return is from a separate effect, YGOPro asks to resolve each separately in EP.
		=> lots of clicks if lots of swaps happened
		=> Current solution: Each Toa returns all of their own banished Kanohi at once, but this might not be the proper handling for this mechanic, since technically each resolution of the effect only establishes that the Kanohi banished in that particular resolution is returned. The difference is relevant because quick effects can be activated in between the returns!
		=> Mabye take a different approach and instead of banishing just prevent the effect from equipping a Kanohi with the same name as a removed one in the same turn.
		
		New version of swap effect: Just equip a Kanohi, let the old one destroy itself, and explicitly prevent swapping into ones destroyed this turn.
		=> old ones are automatically excluded since they self-destruct when the new one is equipped
		=> no banishment and related problems
		=> prevents just equipping a Kanohi right back after it was destroyed, that would feel pretty cheap after all
		
		New version of ATK->0 effect: After damage calculation, but also double battle damage
		=> Gives current version of Hau a justification
		=> Allows Ta-Koro to OTK more reliably without needing a bonus battle damage effect on Lhii
		=> Full-on multiplicative might stack a bit too hard, so maybe change that to inflicting damage equal to original ATK if monster is destroyed by battle (a bit like Ghost Mourner) - also fits the "it's on fire and explodes" visual a bit better

		{{Discard to boost ATK}}
		
		Mata Role: Battle
		
		Principle: Courage
		"To be courageous is to place your responsibility and the safety of others above your own safety."
		=> face stronger monsters in battle
		=> shield allies (force opponent to attack a specific monster, e.g. "Your opponent cannot target FIRE monsters you control for attacks, except the FIRE monster with the highest ATK you control"?) 
		=> better: protect from effects while controlling multiple FIRE, so opponent is forced into battle
		
		Courage grants Strength 
		=> ATK manipulation
		
		The enemy of Courage is Fear
		=> Fear prevents battles from taking place by making monsters "flee"
		
		Battle focus has good synergy with Hau's battle protection.
		Huna forces attacks towards stronger targets, might be redundant with the possible "shield allies" effect listed above.
		
		ATK boost could also be before damage calculation, so you can chain block with this and Tahu, and the opponent gets a chance to add additional boosts afterwards (more courageous that way).
		
		Downgrade effect protection to only prevent destruction - covers basically all cases that occured during testing and is closer to appropriate for generic attribute-wide protection.Also, only count and protect face-ups.

	notes:
		{{Let a monster attack twice}}
		
		Block effects on attack 
		=> unexpectedly moving too fast to respond, opponent literally gets Kapura'd
		=> combos well with ATK  boosting and battle focus of Ta-Koro
		
		
		Interesting concept: stackable activations delayed to End Phase (Inflict damage on SS/draw when leave field) => can it somehow be included? Would be nice as a lore adaptation. Original wording:
		"When this card is Special Summoned: Inflict damage equal to its current ATK to your opponent during the End Phase of this turn. When this card leaves the field: Draw 1 card during the End Phase of this turn."
		
		Maybe:
		During the End Phase: Your opponent takes 200 damage for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Or:
		During the End Phase: Draw 1 card for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Both could also activate from GY, only count some subset of FIRE monsters, count field leaves instead of summons, ...
		
		Completely different approach:
		=> Blocking activations is granted to all C.C. Matoran, either from field or GY (for a limited time in the latter case)
		=> "Going fast by moving slowly" is implemented as giving a second attack to a monster that did not attack in your previous turn (or something like that)
		=> or just a monster that was summoned in a previous turn
		=> More attacks helps Ta-Koro a lot

	notes:
		{{Add Tahu to hand}}
		
		Already has overhaul effects (or lack thereof).
		
		Bonus: Search Tahu when going to GY
		=> no need for search from Tahu's side, since he can just equip the Hau from the GY once you bring him out
		=> Synergy with Copper Kanohi, QftM, Isolde, ...
		=> Can set as bait and plus if opponent takes it
		=> v1.2: Added minor cost and made optional, so you can't get an arbitrary number of free searches off Isolde; banishing monster should barely ever be a problem
		
		Possible mechanical issue: Technically Toa Mata's swap effect can never have any targets at activation while they have Kanohi equipped because that conflicts with the "only one" equip limit.
		=> Simplest solution: Equip Limit is just "Equip only to a Level 6 or higher monster", but there's a second continuous effect stating "If a "Kanohi" Equip Spell Card is equipped to the equipped monster, destroy this card".
		=> Bonus side effect: You can swap with a Kanohi from hand during your turn without banishing the original one.
		=> Self-destruct effect had to be made a trigger effect because YGOPro doesn't like continuous with EVENT_EQUIP :( Big difference: Now the Kanohi won't blow up until the end of the chain, and its attempt to blow up can also be chained to!
		
		Battle protection feels super pointless on a Ta-Koro board ...
		=> maybe "unaffected by effects that do not target it"? (completes the protection, but doesn't make much sense because Hau is weak to surprise attacks and non-targeting matches those better because you don't get advance warning which monster will be hit)

	notes:
		{{Banish and discard to make unaffected}}
		{{Add WATER monster to hand}}
		
		Dislike of compromise: Potentially fix Purity of GY, make monsters unaffected no matter what (without compromise).
		
		Arrow on upper end because Turaga could be designed to have their arrow placements align with the Toa Kaita (Vakama/Whenua/Onewa down, Nokama/Nuju/Matau up, or the other way around). But this actually doesn't make that much sense because Turaga have no Kaita following the same division.
		For Nokama in particular, up arrow allows the protection to apply to either your own monster in the EMZ and your opponent's monster (for disruption in case it needs to be affected by something), but that doesn't quite seem worth giving up the linked zone.
		=> solved by Link 2!
		
		Probably better to send from Deck, otherwise you have the extra condition of needing to keep something in hand if you want protection.
		
		If that's not enough, maybe some other effect that lets you plus to make up for Link 2 summoning?
		=> When this card is Link Summoned: You can target 1 WATER monster in your GY; add that target to your hand.
		=> Possibly with some restriction
		=> Provides discard fodder (potentially even the really good kind since it's WATER monsters) for next turn
		
		Could serve as replacement for Isolde if you can e.g. send any card matching the type of the banished card from deck to gy, but that's probably a bit broken.
		
		Potentially needed buffs:
		=> Recycle on each SS, not just Link?
		==> Recycle when monster summoned to linked zone, that way it's reusable
		==> Discourages opponent from summoning to linked zone on their side, so they can't benefit from protection (though you also lose the rare chance for big brain disruption)
		=> Send WATER from Deck instead of discard (only if precedent!)
		==> There is none, at least not as a quick effect
		==> But reusable recycle effect means previous discards can come back
		=> Maybe Switch top arrow to middle for synergy with Marincess CA (points at EMZ when revived in simplest case) - also sort of aligns with body/head angle in image
		
		Problem: Not having an exception for the own effect is convenient for disruption, but means Nokama is no longer battle protected while unaffected.
		=> Maybe "unaffected by the effects of cards [...], except "Turaga Nokama""?
		==> Also avoids misinterpretations whereby the effect blocks itself because the monster is only affected by it if it isn't
		==> Maybe "except this card's" is better?
		=> For comfort: Make recycling effect mandatory, so you don't misclick it away - want  to activate it pretty much always anyway, and in the cases where not the other effect makes it easy to get the card in question to GY/banished again

		=> More useful replacement effect?
		=> Maybe: "Each player who controls a monster(s) in the Main Monster Zone moves 1 of those monsters to another of their Main Monster Zones" => allows owner to adjust zones as well when protection takes effect, but may screw up placement relative to Nokama
		=> Perhaps even better: "You can move 1 monster in the Main Monster Zone to another Main Monster Zone, then your opponent can move 1 monster in the Main Monster Zone to another Main Monster Zone" => that way the opponent of the one activating the effect (usually you) gets the last word

	notes:
		{{Normal Summon by Tributing from hand}}
		{{Negate effect and gain ATK}}
		{{Equip Kanohi from hand or GY}}
		
		Problem with main eff: "When" misses timing too often, "if" instantly recycles materials & handtraps; Recycling of handtraps may not be safe either way
		
		Alt.: If a monster(s) is banished: You can target 1 of your banished monsters; add it to your hand.
		=> Or target in GY anyway?
		=> Might be hard to trigger reliably, especially in Toa_Mata.dek
		
		Latest version: Not broken and still plenty activatable, but still has problems.
		=> Not triggerable through destruction by battle because no precedent for triggering off both battle destruction and any (including non-destruction) sending to GY by effect
		=> Not triggerable by costs, so WATER synergy is limited, but otherwise you'd be in the convenient handtrap recycling scenario again
		
		Another possibility: Once per turn, if a monster(s) is sent to the GY: You can target 1 Level 4 or lower monster in your GY with a different name than that monster(s); add it to your hand.
		=> No handtrap recycling, but wordy
		=> Also triggers off summon materials, which is not desirable - maybe an "except for a summon" clause is possible?
		=> Or maybe just "sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but then activation requirement becomes non-universal again
		=> maybe "destroyed by battle, or sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but that's a bit uncohesive
		=> precedent for that last one exists on Resort Staff and Firewall Dragon, so I guess we'll take it
		
		Maybe add a discard cost to the effect so it becomes neutral
		=> Would allow triggering Atlanteans etc
		
		Completely new effect:
		=> Trigger on own effect activations so it's more or less a quick effect in both Ga-Koro and Toa Mata decks
		=> Negate effects as disruption (Onua needs something else then), basically disabling targets by putting them underwater - also the most "peaceful" form of offense
		=> Can also negate effects on own field to perhaps stop something negative = mediator role in the team
		=> Negate on every Kanohi switch by a different Toa may be too OP since there's no upper limit once you have 2+ Kanohi - maybe require it to be an effect that targets your own cards? On the other hand, Gali herself does have OPT.
		
		Possible buffs:
		=> Gain LP equal to target's ATK to represent the healing stuff - may muscle in on Onu territory though
		=> Make negate permanent like Onua's originally was
		==> Definitely seems worth considering
		=> Gain ATK after negate (either small boost permanently or large boost temporarily)
		==> Preferred: Permanently
		==> Helps getting over big dudes with protection
		==> TODO: Lore association
		===> Patience + "some situations can only be resolved with overwhelming offensive force"
		=> Might be a problem that the effect becomes impossible to activate unless your monster effect is in the last chain
		==> See how it works in Toa Mata decks first, where Kanohi-switching can always be chained to serve as the trigger

		{{Reveal top card of both Decks and Special Summon}}
		{{Draw 1 card}}
		
		Idea: Make Turaga Link 2 because using a lone Absolute Zero as material for Nokama/Nuju is kinda degenerate, and just attribute+type is a weaker requirement than most other Link 1 monsters. Sneak advantage: Monsters with inappropriate attributes can be linked away as a Turaga's second material.
		
		Need 4 arrows to have 6 distinct combinations of 2 among them - not sure which 4, but these two make the most sense for Vakama at least because it lets him co-link with Knightmare Phoenix.
		
		This way the summon is a -1, so the effect should do more than generate slight virtual advantage.
		
		Draw when FIRE Warrior destroyed by battle: Combos with self (run over opponent's Token to draw), Ta-Koro (forces opponent into battle if you have 2 or more FIRE monsters), and Huna (forces opponent to attack other monsters, likely FIRE Warriors). Possibly redundant with Kapura's current GY effect.
		=> Draw 2 because destroying by battle is a difficult condition and you need to make up for the discard from the Ta-Koro combo
		=> Maybe even "If a monster is destroyed in a battle involving a FIRE Warrior monster"?
		=> Draw 2 could be abused generically by crashing the Tokens into each other, so maybe stick with 1 for now and see how that works without Kapura's draws.
		
		Effect gets kinda long now :(

		GY eff: To get some use after summoning with Isolde, "sneak out" while nobody is watching, then get sent "home" to Deck.
		=> May not be necessary if you're running multiple anyway, but test
		=> Not really much synergy with Ga-Koro...
		v2: Sneak out "repeatedly" on opponent's turn, so it gets Ga-Koro's speed boost and fulfills Nokama's battle protection condition after being used to summon her.
		=> Maybe even banish a card from GY as cost so you get rid of Isolde?
		v3: Trigger on activation of opponent's card and summon to same column.
		=> Sneak out when something interesting happens, to where that is happening
		=> qualifies for updated Ga-Koro speed boost because CL2+
		=> Makes text hella long
		
		Buffs:
		=> reduce ATK on summon from GY, so there's some use to doing that during the opponent's turn even if Maku doesn't survive
		==> sneaking out to see Huki on the "other" team (Po-Koro), getting comfy with him so combat-readiness drops
		==> Maybe even give Huki an ATK boost effect to interact with this
		=> instead of lowering ATK, change to defense position - fits the "getting comfy" interpretation better and more effectively neutralizes Huki

		{{Special Summon WATER monster from hand}}
		{{Affected by "Ga-Koro, Village of Water": Cannot Special Summon from Extra Deck, except WATER monsters}}
		
		
		Mata Role: Disruption
		
		Completely different approach to the same idea: Propagate purity from one location to others (=> ripples!), SS from hand/GY for Speed while also automatically providing a WATER Warrior (or any other type). Also adjust Level to enable Bahamut, Toad plays.
		
		Wording for part after "then" of latest version really needs work.
		
		Or, a more balanced version of the old approach:
		During your opponent's turn, if all monsters in your GY are WATER, your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects.
		=> Fixes the weakness to responses in Nokama's and Maku's effects.
		=> Literally grants +2 Spell Speed (from Quick Effect to unrespondable)
		=> Maybe during your turn it does the hand=WATER thing instead?
		=> Might not even need the secondary SS effect this way, since Speed is already covered
		Surprisingly concise version of that, including a bit of a restriction so Crystrons can't quite do all their stuff with it up:
		"You cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except WATER monsters. If all monsters in your GY (min. 1) are WATER, apply this effect, depending on whose turn it is.
		*Your turn: All monsters in your hand become WATER.
		*Opponent's turn: Your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects."
		
		Effect to summon from hand added again because there tend to be some cards left in hand you can't get out otherwise.
		
		Potential problem: Crystron Synergy!
		=> maybe there's some way to have the added spell speed only for "defensive" effects?
		=> added "as Chain Link 2 or higher" clause which fixes that problem, but potentially limits usefulness in other ways
		
		Adjusting Level on 2nd eff would be really good for Toad purposes.
		
		Ideas for Poison as enemy of purity:
		=> Change attribute of monsters in GY
		=> Continuously negate effects/prevent their activation (so even Spell Speed 4 is useless)
		
		General potentially needed buffs for Ga Decks:
		=> resistance to battle
		==> Maybe "your opponent cannot target WATER monsters you control for attacks, except the WATER monster with the highest ATK you control" on something
		==> or make Nokama untargetable/indestructible by battle while pointing to a monster
		==> or make Gali suppress battle in addition to effects
		
		Potentialy buffs:
		=> Give CL2 speed boost during own turn as well - rather not, because right now we have a certain level of focus on the opponent's turn
		
		Note: ED restriction can be circumvented if you have two - just set one to replace the face-up one
		=> Maybe make that a lingering effect when activating the summon or the card?

	notes:
		Tuner because Hal synergy
		
		Maybe some effect to get more S/T in the GY so Nokama can immunize more against monsters - sort of feels right for the Astrologer profession as well. Example:
		"If a WATER monster is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: You can send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck, then draw 1 card."
		=> Can trigger during either player's turn so you can chain to it for Ga-Koro immunity
		=> (Probably) triggers if used as material for Nokama, so that's convenient
		=> Dumps S/T as cost, so even if you negate it you get the fodder (probably bad design since it's a pseudo-cost, should be altered)
		=> Draw 1 to keep up fodder for Nokama, place self on bottom of Deck to limit reuse
		=> Maybe the bottom of deck + draw 1 business can be tied into Astrology as well
		
		New and mechanically improved:
		"If a WATER monster(s) is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: If there are no Spells/Traps in your GY, send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to your GY, otherwise send the top card of your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck."
		=> Now only does targeted dumping in the specific situation where you don't have any S/T as Nokama fodder
		=> Otherwise sends random card, which may be good or not - top card matches Vakama's "vision" theme so that might fit with astrology
		=> Dumping is still cost so if you get the random card and it's an Atlantean you can get the effect
		=> Exact relation to astrology still TODO
		
		Other considerations:
		=> A way to SS easily may be useful if it's to replace Arboria
		=> Noodle may be banned at some point, so don't rely too hard on the summon from deck
		=> To reach more Synchro levels with Lv2 Matoran, level manipulation might be an idea - would also fit with astrology because "stars"
		=> Don't do ALL of the above because that would be way too many effects!

		=> doesn't become super inefficient when you're far ahead in LP
		=> no need to account for possible difference between LP at activation and resolution in code
		=> may or may not still require higher LP at activation
		=> use case where you can go +2 by being even just 100 LP ahead  may be problematic
		==> "then, if your LP are lower than your opponent's, discard 1 card for every 1000 points difference" might fix that

		LP gain = overseeing the work (work here being the process of using up your monsters)
		=> Potentially better to put this on Onu-Koro and the active LP gain effect from Onu-Koro on Whenua 
		=> Something for the other kind of work (reducing opponent's LP) as well? Would bring immediate synergy with potential burn effect for Ruru...
		Search something new = studying the past to avoid future problems
		=> past = GY
		=> avoiding future problems = getting some monster you haven't tried yet
		=> very likely too generic (only EARTH? only EARTH Warrior?)
		=> shuffling monsters from GY back conflicts with Onu-Koro a bit (might not have enough monsters for both)
		=> More accessible version: On Link Summon, search an EARTH Warrior with a different name than everything in GY (makes up for the summon minus, so Onu-Koro wealth is not impacted)
		==> no shuffling back, because that would be stealing resources Onu-Koro needs

		Mata Role: Extra Deck Summoning
		
		Idea: Use tokens to contribute to ED summons pretty much universally, reward successful ED summons under EARTH restriction with recycling of resources for combo purposes.
		=> Further restrictions?
		=> More specific targets for recycling effect?
		=> Make it so eff 2 has general EARTH lock for the whole turn?
		
		Principle: Creation.
		"Creation was the concept of making new things."
		=> Extra Deck Summons
		=> Possible overlap with C.C. Matoran
		=> Tokens are literally created!
		
		Creation grants Strategy.
		=> Some big brain stuff with ED monsters?
		=> Combos
		
		The enemy of Creation is Disintegration.
		=> some form of removal that hits harder against Extra Deck monsters (e.g. return to hand?)
		
		Alternative idea:
		"If a monster is Special Summoned from the Extra Deck using materials on the field, and all materials sent from the field to your GY for that Summon are EARTH Warrior monsters: You can Special Summon those monsters from the GY, but they cannot be used as material, also banish them when they leave the field. If you control no monsters: You can shuffle 1 of your banished EARTH Warrior monsters into the Deck; Special Summon 1 "Sculpture Token". You can only use each effect of "Po-Koro, Village of Stone" once per turn."
		=> More emphasis on EARTH Warriors (Po-Matoran) as "sculptors"
		=> Translates being used as material to crafting an Extra Deck monster (i.e., the crafters stay around after its finished)
		=> Second effect keeps the literal "creation" of Tokens as a recovery mechanism that also recycles the Po-Matoran banished by effect 1.
		=> Check legality of generic "material" clauses!
