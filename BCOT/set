		Already has overhaul effects.
		
		Further overhaul should do the following:
		-) Feasible boss monster for Ta-Koro deck
		-) Feasible part of a multi-Toa deck (Kaita or even all six)
		-) Depict the process of being lost in the ocean for a long time before finally coming to rescue the Matoran somehow (e.g. SS condition that requires (FIRE) monsters in your GY and opponent to control monsters)
		
		General Toa Mata effect structure:
		1) Allow Tributes from hand (maybe with some restriction like not attacking the turn it's summoned like that?)
		2) Effect supporting the Koro's playstyle
		3) Kanohi cycling
		
		For Tahu, 2) does ATK reduction to help with battle. Could also be a continuous effect, or only trigger on own summon (but be more powerful), or do burn damage when a FIRE monster destroys a monster by battle, or do something on attack declaration (could be safely activated in combination with Hau, since Tahu can then just attack whatever) ...
		Maybe: "Once per turn, when a monster you control gains ATK: You can make all monsters your opponent controls lose the same amount of ATK." Downside: Doesn't activate on own summon.
		
		Alt 2): Once per turn, before damage calculation: ... (more flexible)
		
		
		Problem with fancy new Kanohi equipping effect: Link Isolde, send 6 Kanohi, Special Summon Toa --> any 2 Warriors equal a nearly free Toa Mata able to cycle through the full ass of protection and buffs
		=> too easy, especially since the key card is entirely unrelated to the archetype
		=> on the other hand, running 6 different Kanohi is a gimmick deck anyway, so maybe Isolde enabling that isn't too bad
		=> but Golden Kanohi should definitely be changed
		
		Usability issue with swap effect returning Kanohi: Since each return is from a separate effect, YGOPro asks to resolve each separately in EP.
		=> lots of clicks if lots of swaps happened
		=> Current solution: Each Toa returns all of their own banished Kanohi at once, but this might not be the proper handling for this mechanic, since technically each resolution of the effect only establishes that the Kanohi banished in that particular resolution is returned. The difference is relevant because quick effects can be activated in between the returns!
		=> Mabye take a different approach and instead of banishing just prevent the effect from equipping a Kanohi with the same name as a removed one in the same turn.
		
		New version of swap effect: Just equip a Kanohi, let the old one destroy itself, and explicitly prevent swapping into ones destroyed this turn.
		=> old ones are automatically excluded since they self-destruct when the new one is equipped
		=> no banishment and related problems
		=> prevents just equipping a Kanohi right back after it was destroyed, that would feel pretty cheap after all
		
		New version of ATK->0 effect: After damage calculation, but also double battle damage
		=> Gives current version of Hau a justification
		=> Allows Ta-Koro to OTK more reliably without needing a bonus battle damage effect on Lhii
		=> Full-on multiplicative might stack a bit too hard, so maybe change that to inflicting damage equal to original ATK if monster is destroyed by battle (a bit like Ghost Mourner) - also fits the "it's on fire and explodes" visual a bit better

		{{Reveal a monster and add a matching Field Spell}}
		{{Activate "The Island of Mata Nui"}}
		
		On activate: Search Koro
		=> Alternative approach: "You can reveal 1 monster in your hand, or target 1 face-up monster you control; add 1 "-Koro" Field Spell Card from your Deck to your hand that lists that monster's Attribute in its text."
		==> Requires a monster and only searches the appropriate Koro for it
		==> Strictly weaker than the basic search, so it makes sense to use this if we need a nerf for the effect or want to add additional functionality
		=> Similar alternative, but as a buff: "You can shuffle 2 cards from your hand into the Deck, then add 2 cards (1 "-Koro" Field Spell Card and 1 Level 4 or lower Warrior monster whose Attribute is listed in that card's text) from your Deck to your hand."
		==> technically no longer a plus like the original, but this way you can instantly fetch both pieces needed to get started with Koro strategies
		=> Could also combine nerf and buff somehow, e.g. return a monster with X Attribute from hand or field to Deck to get Koro + Warrior of same Attribute
		When Koro/Field Spell in general destroyed: Add from GY to hand
		
		Toa Mata protection, attribute lock?
		
		Writing up the envisioned effect in its latest state reveals that it's way too long (139W/726C)...
		=> sacrifice some part of the Kini-Nui synergy?
		=> do not allow searching a -Koro when revealing Toa Mata (would allow a more compact phrasing for the search)?
		=> somehow use less words to describe the Attribute matching with the Koro?
		
		First takeaway from practical test: Making the send to GY a cost means it can't be used again after re-activating, because it would be banished instead...
		=> guess we'll make that part of the effect instead, if it gets Ghost Ogred so be it
		=> also just say destroy to make sure the "then" doesn't fuck us up either
		=> The "During your Main Phase" makes the card text just long enough so it would set a new word count record, guess we'll cut the probably meaningless stat boost
		=> Maybe the better move would be too drop the self-pop entirely, you're activating the new field spell over Mata Nui anyway
		==> that leaves us with enough room to include the stat boost as well :D

		{{Discard to boost ATK}}
		
		Mata Role: Battle
		
		Principle: Courage
		"To be courageous is to place your responsibility and the safety of others above your own safety."
		=> face stronger monsters in battle
		=> shield allies (force opponent to attack a specific monster, e.g. "Your opponent cannot target FIRE monsters you control for attacks, except the FIRE monster with the highest ATK you control"?) 
		=> better: protect from effects while controlling multiple FIRE, so opponent is forced into battle
		
		Courage grants Strength 
		=> ATK manipulation
		
		The enemy of Courage is Fear
		=> Fear prevents battles from taking place by making monsters "flee"
		
		Battle focus has good synergy with Hau's battle protection.
		Huna forces attacks towards stronger targets, might be redundant with the possible "shield allies" effect listed above.
		
		ATK boost could also be before damage calculation, so you can chain block with this and Tahu, and the opponent gets a chance to add additional boosts afterwards (more courageous that way).
		
		Downgrade effect protection to only prevent destruction - covers basically all cases that occured during testing and is closer to appropriate for generic attribute-wide protection.Also, only count and protect face-ups.

		{{Let a monster attack twice}}
		
		Block effects on attack 
		=> unexpectedly moving too fast to respond, opponent literally gets Kapura'd
		=> combos well with ATK  boosting and battle focus of Ta-Koro
		
		
		Interesting concept: stackable activations delayed to End Phase (Inflict damage on SS/draw when leave field) => can it somehow be included? Would be nice as a lore adaptation. Original wording:
		"When this card is Special Summoned: Inflict damage equal to its current ATK to your opponent during the End Phase of this turn. When this card leaves the field: Draw 1 card during the End Phase of this turn."
		
		Maybe:
		During the End Phase: Your opponent takes 200 damage for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Or:
		During the End Phase: Draw 1 card for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Both could also activate from GY, only count some subset of FIRE monsters, count field leaves instead of summons, ...
		
		Completely different approach:
		=> Blocking activations is granted to all C.C. Matoran, either from field or GY (for a limited time in the latter case)
		=> "Going fast by moving slowly" is implemented as giving a second attack to a monster that did not attack in your previous turn (or something like that)
		=> or just a monster that was summoned in a previous turn
		=> More attacks helps Ta-Koro a lot
		==> Maybe just attacks on monsters? Possibly too powerful for the sole requirement of having any monster survive for a turn

	notes:
		{{Add Tahu to hand}}
		
		Already has overhaul effects (or lack thereof).
		
		Bonus: Search Tahu when going to GY
		=> no need for search from Tahu's side, since he can just equip the Hau from the GY once you bring him out
		=> Synergy with Copper Kanohi, QftM, Isolde, ...
		=> Can set as bait and plus if opponent takes it
		=> v1.2: Added minor cost and made optional, so you can't get an arbitrary number of free searches off Isolde; banishing monster should barely ever be a problem
		
		Possible mechanical issue: Technically Toa Mata's swap effect can never have any targets at activation while they have Kanohi equipped because that conflicts with the "only one" equip limit.
		=> Simplest solution: Equip Limit is just "Equip only to a Level 6 or higher monster", but there's a second continuous effect stating "If a "Kanohi" Equip Spell Card is equipped to the equipped monster, destroy this card".
		=> Bonus side effect: You can swap with a Kanohi from hand during your turn without banishing the original one.
		=> Self-destruct effect had to be made a trigger effect because YGOPro doesn't like continuous with EVENT_EQUIP :( Big difference: Now the Kanohi won't blow up until the end of the chain, and its attempt to blow up can also be chained to!
		==> oh wait, that was just because trigger effects have implicit effect relation and continuous do not - fixed now
		
		Battle protection feels super pointless on a Ta-Koro board ...
		=> maybe "unaffected by effects that do not target it"? (completes the protection, but doesn't make much sense because Hau is weak to surprise attacks and non-targeting matches those better because you don't get advance warning which monster will be hit)
		
		Alternate approach to mental focus restriction: Allow equipping to any monster, but only give effects when equipped to an appropriate monster.
		=> e.g. "If the equipped monster is a "Toa" or "Makuta" monster, it cannot be destroyed by battle, also you take no battle damage from battles involving that monster."
		=> makes it feasible to use Kanohi in hand for searches
		=> leaves more room for stricter archetype restrictions, which in turn means I have more freedom with the effects
		=> perhaps provides a good hook for any non-regular Kanohi users (Axonn, Brutaka) to just have an effect that states a Kanohi equipped to them gains its effects anyway => longer variant that might be even better for that (since it explicitly states the effect is gained): "While this card is equipped to a "Toa" or "Makuta" monster, it gains this effect.
		* The equipped monster cannot be destroyed by battle, also you take no battle damage from battles involving that monster"

	notes:
		{{Banish and discard to make unaffected}}
		{{Add WATER monster to hand}}
		
		Dislike of compromise: Potentially fix Purity of GY, make monsters unaffected no matter what (without compromise).
		
		Arrow on upper end because Turaga could be designed to have their arrow placements align with the Toa Kaita (Vakama/Whenua/Onewa down, Nokama/Nuju/Matau up, or the other way around). But this actually doesn't make that much sense because Turaga have no Kaita following the same division.
		For Nokama in particular, up arrow allows the protection to apply to either your own monster in the EMZ and your opponent's monster (for disruption in case it needs to be affected by something), but that doesn't quite seem worth giving up the linked zone.
		=> solved by Link 2!
		
		Probably better to send from Deck, otherwise you have the extra condition of needing to keep something in hand if you want protection.
		
		If that's not enough, maybe some other effect that lets you plus to make up for Link 2 summoning?
		=> When this card is Link Summoned: You can target 1 WATER monster in your GY; add that target to your hand.
		=> Possibly with some restriction
		=> Provides discard fodder (potentially even the really good kind since it's WATER monsters) for next turn
		
		Could serve as replacement for Isolde if you can e.g. send any card matching the type of the banished card from deck to gy, but that's probably a bit broken.
		
		Potentially needed buffs:
		=> Recycle on each SS, not just Link?
		==> Recycle when monster summoned to linked zone, that way it's reusable
		==> Discourages opponent from summoning to linked zone on their side, so they can't benefit from protection (though you also lose the rare chance for big brain disruption)
		==> Updated: Trigger is pointing to a monster during opponent's End Phase, so it isn't just a better WATER version of Sunlight Wolf
		===> Matches the idea of protecting your own monster in the linked zone, and still derives benefit from opponent foolishly putting one of their monsters there
		===> Explicitly triggering during opponent's turn fits with Ga-Koro
		=> Send WATER from Deck instead of discard (only if precedent!)
		==> There is none, at least not as a quick effect
		==> But reusable recycle effect means previous discards can come back
		=> Maybe Switch top arrow to middle for synergy with Marincess CA (points at EMZ when revived in simplest case) - also sort of aligns with body/head angle in image
		
		Problem: Not having an exception for the own effect is convenient for disruption, but means Nokama is no longer battle protected while unaffected.
		=> Maybe "unaffected by the effects of cards [...], except "Turaga Nokama""?
		==> Also avoids misinterpretations whereby the effect blocks itself because the monster is only affected by it if it isn't
		==> Maybe "except this card's" is better?
		=> For comfort: Make recycling effect mandatory, so you don't misclick it away - want  to activate it pretty much always anyway, and in the cases where not the other effect makes it easy to get the card in question to GY/banished again

		Another possibility: Once per turn, if a monster(s) is sent to the GY: You can target 1 Level 4 or lower monster in your GY with a different name than that monster(s); add it to your hand.
		=> No handtrap recycling, but wordy
		=> Also triggers off summon materials, which is not desirable - maybe an "except for a summon" clause is possible?
		=> Or maybe just "sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but then activation requirement becomes non-universal again
		=> maybe "destroyed by battle, or sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but that's a bit uncohesive
		=> precedent for that last one exists on Resort Staff and Firewall Dragon, so I guess we'll take it
		
		Maybe add a discard cost to the effect so it becomes neutral
		=> Would allow triggering Atlanteans etc
		
		Completely new effect:
		=> Trigger on own effect activations so it's more or less a quick effect in both Ga-Koro and Toa Mata decks
		=> Negate effects as disruption (Onua needs something else then), basically disabling targets by putting them underwater - also the most "peaceful" form of offense
		=> Can also negate effects on own field to perhaps stop something negative = mediator role in the team
		=> Negate on every Kanohi switch by a different Toa may be too OP since there's no upper limit once you have 2+ Kanohi - maybe require it to be an effect that targets your own cards? On the other hand, Gali herself does have OPT.
		
		Possible buffs:
		=> Gain LP equal to target's ATK to represent the healing stuff - may muscle in on Onu territory though
		=> Make negate permanent like Onua's originally was
		==> Definitely seems worth considering
		=> Gain ATK after negate (either small boost permanently or large boost temporarily)
		==> Preferred: Permanently
		==> Helps getting over big dudes with protection
		==> TODO: Lore association
		===> Patience + "some situations can only be resolved with overwhelming offensive force"
		=> Might be a problem that the effect becomes impossible to activate unless your monster effect is last in the chain
		==> See how it works in Toa Mata decks first, where Kanohi-switching can always be chained to serve as the trigger
		==> Kanohi-switching has been moved to the Suva, so the trigger should probably be made more accessible
		===> Slightly more involved idea: "Once per turn, if the turn player's opponent activates a monster effect: ..."
		====> "Turn player's opponent" (c) Octobypass
		====> Works as it used to on the opponent's turn, so Ga-Koro can make the fullest use of it
		====> But also serves as an anti-disruption tool on your turn
		====> This wording would make it easy to expand the scope of triggering effects to cover all cards (monster effect -> card or effect), but not sure if that's a good idea
		====> Still breaks when stuff is chained to an applicable effect, but searching backwards in the chain looks so contrived...

		Idea: Make Turaga Link 2 because using a lone Absolute Zero as material for Nokama/Nuju is kinda degenerate, and just attribute+type is a weaker requirement than most other Link 1 monsters. Sneak advantage: Monsters with inappropriate attributes can be linked away as a Turaga's second material.
		
		Need 4 arrows to have 6 distinct combinations of 2 among them - not sure which 4, but these two make the most sense for Vakama at least because it lets him co-link with Knightmare Phoenix.
		
		This way the summon is a -1, so the effect should do more than generate slight virtual advantage.
		
		Draw when FIRE Warrior destroyed by battle: Combos with self (run over opponent's Token to draw), Ta-Koro (forces opponent into battle if you have 2 or more FIRE monsters), and Huna (forces opponent to attack other monsters, likely FIRE Warriors). Possibly redundant with Kapura's current GY effect.
		=> Draw 2 because destroying by battle is a difficult condition and you need to make up for the discard from the Ta-Koro combo
		=> Maybe even "If a monster is destroyed in a battle involving a FIRE Warrior monster"?
		=> Draw 2 could be abused generically by crashing the Tokens into each other, so maybe stick with 1 for now and see how that works without Kapura's draws.
		
		Effect gets kinda long now :(

		Originally effect negation, but when should that trigger and how does it fit into Onu-Koro.dek?
		
		Effect: Add monster from GY
		=> Adds resources to fill the resource generation role

		=> Goes well with Tahu for Akamai.dek
		=> Pakari increases ATK, therefore damage, therefore range of monsters that can be added
		=> May clash with Onu-Koro removing monsters from GY
		
		Alternate effect: Once per turn, if/when a card(s)/monster(s) is sent to the GY (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card in either GY; if that target is a monster with less ATK than this card, gain LP equal to half its ATK, also place it on the top or the bottom of the Deck."
		=> Complies with Onu-Koro strategy of recycling resources, and complements it by also being able to get S/T back into the Deck
		=> Can potentially serve as GY disruption on the opponent's turn, meaning Onua reinforces to the Onu deck's somewhat lacking ability to put up interaction turn 1
		=> Symbolism is basically the same as the other effect (i.e., just Drill Warrior)
		=> Activation condition is more easily fullfilled outside BP

		Effect: Kick S/T to pieces, also gets a bonus if there's a Rock around as a sneaky reference to the rock kicking function - triggered by ED summon for Po-Koro synergy
		=> The S/T reduction by itself could actually work without even the soft OPT restriction, the bonus burn on the other hand kind of warrants a hard one
		=> Maybe instead of burn, make it so having a Rock prevents activation of the targeted card (because it's destroyed by kicking a rock at it from a distance and therefore the opponent is caught by surprise), then it could be unlimited
		==> Also good idea for bonus: Destroy an additional card (think ricochet), if it's without targeting you kind of get the benefit of not being able to chain too
		===> Maybe destroy your Rock as well in that case, to make a more fair trade and because the Rock probably doesn't survive getting kicked
		===> Second destruction could even include monsters, because that process kind of resembles "creative heroic thinking" - would be way stronger, though
		=> Could also be triggered by Tribute Summons (in addition to ED summons), since it's also a form of the Po-Koro idea of "creating" something bigger out of materials and would have synergy with Toa Mata in general - whether that's justifiable or not depends on how Po-Koro turns out
		==> Perhaps better: Also trigger on ED effect activations, so it works on/against an established board

		{{Normal Summon by Tributing from hand}}
		{{Banish 1 card your opponent controls}}
		
		No idea what the effect should be yet, but maybe something continuous so it works with Ko-Koro better?
		=> Activated (to mesh with e.g. Gali), but intended specifically for the case where Ko-Koro is removed from the field - in that case, retaliate by banishing (freezing) and set up your own protection
		
		Or:
		"If this Attack Position card battles an opponent's monster, that monster loses 500 ATK and its effects are negated, during the Damage Step only. If this card is in face-up Defense Position, your opponent cannot  target monsters for attacks, except "Toa Mata Kopaka". Once per turn, if this card inflicts battle damage to your opponent: You can change its battle position, and if you do, banish 1 card your opponent controls."
		=> Nerf opponent's monsters with "cold", so he's effectively 2500 ATK and you can get over stuff to help Ko-Koro with the game-winning push
		=> In defense, provides a decent substitute for Ko-Koro's attack prevention in case that's turned off
		=> Changing position on damage enables the sequence "turn Ko-Koro off by attacking => switch Kopaka to fill the gap", banishing (freezing) a card provides a non-targeting removal option
		=> Problem A: Too long!
		=> Problem B: Activated effect triggers during damage step, so doesn't actually interact with Gali (neither does Tahu's, though)
		=> Problem C: Battle damage might not be a strong enough condition to justify non-targeting banish, no precedent in that regard
		
		v3.16.2: Converging both ideas, we now have the defense position attack protection plus a Dante effect to enable it (which doesn't activate!), with the trigger effect being the same as the original one, but without any position-changing (gives us at least theoretical access to non-targeting removal)

		=> May want to expand possible targets to face-down monsters as well
		=> Updated to function similar to Pohatu's effect, where you get an additional non-targeting bounce under a condition (in this case, spending the first bounce on your own monster)
		==> Provides a native non-targeting removal option
		==> "then" conjunction means failing to bounce your target (maybe because of some protection like Miru?) fucks the whole effect up, more resilient phrasing would be "[...]; if you control that target, you can return 1 other monster on the field to the hand, also return that target to the hand."

		Handtrap eff: Protect any card from (usually) 1 effect, and Matoran (in particular Huki & stuff summoned with Hafu) from all in that turn. Basis: Boating, swimming lessons.
		
		GY eff: To get some use after summoning with Isolde, "sneak out" while nobody is watching, then get sent "home" to Deck.
		=> May not be necessary if you're running multiple anyway, but test
		=> Not really much synergy with Ga-Koro...
		v2: Sneak out "repeatedly" on opponent's turn, so it gets Ga-Koro's speed boost and fulfills Nokama's battle protection condition after being used to summon her.
		=> Maybe even banish a card from GY as cost so you get rid of Isolde?
		v3: Trigger on activation of opponent's card and summon to same column.
		=> Sneak out when something interesting happens, to where that is happening
		=> qualifies for updated Ga-Koro speed boost because CL2+
		=> Makes text hella long
		
		Buffs:
		=> reduce ATK on summon from GY, so there's some use to doing that during the opponent's turn even if Maku doesn't survive
		==> sneaking out to see Huki on the "other" team (Po-Koro), getting comfy with him so combat-readiness drops
		==> Maybe even give Huki an ATK boost effect to interact with this
		=> instead of lowering ATK, change to defense position - fits the "getting comfy" interpretation better and more effectively neutralizes Huki

		Problem with Forbidden Lance on Steroids: Would also keep Tahu's ATK reduction from taking effect (would it?), so that's a bit conflicting.

		Another idea: "If a FIRE monster you control battles an opponent's monster, at the start of the Damage Step: You can send this card from your hand to the GY; until the end of the Damage Step, negate that opponent's monster's effects. If a FIRE Warrior monster you control destroys an opponent's monster by battle while this card is in your GY: You can Special Summon this card, and if you do, it gains ATK equal to the destroyed monster's original ATK in the GY, until the end of this turn. You can only use 1 "Matoran Legend Lhii" effect per turn, and only once that turn."
		=> only keep the negation part of the hand effect to avoid fucking up other things, the rest was a bit niche in application anyway
		=> GY effect gives you an additional big attacker if e.g. Lhii is discarded for Ta-Koro's ATK boost to get over a beater
		=> only 1 per turn so you can't discard for a battle and then summon off that same battle's destruction
		=> v3.20.0: Adopted & adapted for latest PSCT
		==> hand effect is now a QE during the Damage Step (like Honest) and includes stat modulation so it's clear that it can be activated up to damage calculation
		==> also works when attacked and lasts until the end of the turn instead of damage step, so you can potentially fuck with something in MP2 when your monster gets hit over

		Completely different approach to the same idea: Propagate purity from one location to others (=> ripples!), SS from hand/GY for Speed while also automatically providing a WATER Warrior (or any other type). Also adjust Level to enable Bahamut, Toad plays.
		
		Wording for part after "then" of latest version really needs work.
		
		Or, a more balanced version of the old approach:
		During your opponent's turn, if all monsters in your GY are WATER, your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects.
		=> Fixes the weakness to responses in Nokama's and Maku's effects.
		=> Literally grants +2 Spell Speed (from Quick Effect to unrespondable)
		=> Maybe during your turn it does the hand=WATER thing instead?
		=> Might not even need the secondary SS effect this way, since Speed is already covered
		Surprisingly concise version of that, including a bit of a restriction so Crystrons can't quite do all their stuff with it up:
		"You cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except WATER monsters. If all monsters in your GY (min. 1) are WATER, apply this effect, depending on whose turn it is.
		*Your turn: All monsters in your hand become WATER.
		*Opponent's turn: Your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects."
		
		Effect to summon from hand added again because there tend to be some cards left in hand you can't get out otherwise.
		
		Potential problem: Crystron Synergy!
		=> maybe there's some way to have the added spell speed only for "defensive" effects?
		=> added "as Chain Link 2 or higher" clause which fixes that problem, but potentially limits usefulness in other ways
		
		Adjusting Level on 2nd eff would be really good for Toad purposes.
		
		Ideas for Poison as enemy of purity:
		=> Change attribute of monsters in GY
		=> Continuously negate effects/prevent their activation (so even Spell Speed 4 is useless)
		
		General potentially needed buffs for Ga Decks:
		=> resistance to battle
		==> Maybe "your opponent cannot target WATER monsters you control for attacks, except the WATER monster with the highest ATK you control" on something
		==> or make Nokama untargetable/indestructible by battle while pointing to a monster
		==> or make Gali suppress battle in addition to effects
		
		Potentialy buffs:
		=> Give CL2 speed boost during own turn as well - rather not, because right now we have a certain level of focus on the opponent's turn
		
		Note: ED restriction can be circumvented if you have two - just set one to replace the face-up one
		=> Maybe make that a lingering effect when activating the summon or the card?

		Tuner because Hal synergy
		
		Maybe some effect to get more S/T in the GY so Nokama can immunize more against monsters - sort of feels right for the Astrologer profession as well. Example:
		"If a WATER monster is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: You can send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck, then draw 1 card."
		=> Can trigger during either player's turn so you can chain to it for Ga-Koro immunity
		=> (Probably) triggers if used as material for Nokama, so that's convenient
		=> Dumps S/T as cost, so even if you negate it you get the fodder (probably bad design since it's a pseudo-cost, should be altered)
		=> Draw 1 to keep up fodder for Nokama, place self on bottom of Deck to limit reuse
		=> Maybe the bottom of deck + draw 1 business can be tied into Astrology as well
		
		New and mechanically improved:
		"If a WATER monster(s) is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: If there are no Spells/Traps in your GY, send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to your GY, otherwise send the top card of your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck."
		=> Now only does targeted dumping in the specific situation where you don't have any S/T as Nokama fodder
		=> Otherwise sends random card, which may be good or not - top card matches Vakama's "vision" theme so that might fit with astrology
		=> Dumping is still cost so if you get the random card and it's an Atlantean you can get the effect
		=> Exact relation to astrology still TODO
		
		Other considerations:
		=> A way to SS easily may be useful if it's to replace Arboria
		=> Noodle may be banned at some point, so don't rely too hard on the summon from deck
		=> To reach more Synchro levels with Lv2 Matoran, level manipulation might be an idea - would also fit with astrology because "stars"
		=> Don't do ALL of the above because that would be way too many effects!
		
		v3.20.0: Settled for a different approach incorporating ideas from above, may still need some significant tweaks
		=> Does stuff with Level "stars" as part of a self-SS from hand when you NS a WATER monster
		==> No Warrior or "Matoran" requirement, since WATER is one of the Attributes that needs more mixing with other Types
		==> When summoning another Lv2 Matoran, this ends you up with Lv1+Lv2 = Tatsunoko access
		===> Or just Nokama, or Isolde, or Halq - lots of possibilities
		==> Cannot be activated right after being searched with Kopeke since it wasn't in the hand on NS (see Stick/Chair rulings), so that nicely limits the Ga-/Ko- synergy
		=> Now mills when going from hand or field to GY, so she can trigger off Nokama's cost
		==> milling as cost for some secondary benefit (draw 1 to instantly replenish Nokama fodder?) would be even better and trigger Atlanteans, but would need to find precedent for costs with different modes
		==> or we just mill always and make the S/T send part of the effect, that's also a bit more balanced
		=> Maybe a problem: Special Summon from hand, then do something convenient when sent to the GY is the same structure as Jaa, and there's also some unwanted synergy with one milling a S/T and the other needing to put one back for a SS

		{{Normal Summon (Kini-Nui)}}
		{{Special Summon tributed "Toa" from GY}}
		{{Destroy Kini-Nui to summon a Rock}}
		
		Alternate approach to Kanohi-switching effect, so that doesn't have to repeated on every Toa.
		
		Thematically having it on the Suva makes more sense, so the Kini-Nui can do something else as the designated Toa Mata field spell.
		=> Extra NS for Toa Mata?
		=> Trigger when tributing from hand / tributing a Toa Mata for a Toa Mata?
		=> searching/recycling?
		
		All specific features (Suva Kaita, Golden Kanohi, Amaja Nui, Toa Stones) are already separate cards, so all that's left here is basic utility for Toa Mata with no direct lore correspondence.
		=> Extra NS - we can tribute from hand, so that allows doing a lot more
		=> Recycle on tribute summon - to make up for cards lost in the process
		==> Especially useful when tributing a Toa Mata for a Toa Mata
		==> Recycles Toa in general, so it works on Kaita, Nuva, and theoretically later generations (practically the card has no place in non-Mata decks)
		
		Recycling effect probably needs a bit of a buff
		=>  allow targets outside of Toa so it's basically always live - e.g. "You can target 1 "Toa" monster or 1 monster with the same Attribute as the Summoned monster in your GY; add it to your hand"?
		=> Special summon instead of adding to your hand, probably with discard cost (which could help ditching Kanohi for searches)?
		=> Instead of triggering on Tribute Summon, make it an ignition effect with the condition of controlling a (Tribute Summoned) Toa Mata?
		=> Maybe work specifically with the Tribute rather than a selected monster - "If a monster(s) is Tributed for the Tribute Summon of a "Toa Mata" monster and sent to the GY: You can target 1 of those monsters; if it is a "Toa" monster, Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position, otherwise add it to your hand."
		==> Makes the effect (almost) always live by definition
		==> Distinction between archetypal and other targets justifies Special Summoning instead of just adding
		==> Similar trigger actually already exists on SHS Trumpeter
		==> Bad synergy with Suva, since it needs to be in the GY for the SS effect
		
		Empirical result: Want to run at 3 because it makes it much easier to summon Toa, but multiples are useless
		=> Additional effect that sends self to GY as cost to get something useful would help, since having a second copy would effectively make that free
		=> "You can send this card from the Field Zone to the GY; add 1 Level 1 Rock monster (with 0 ATK/DEF) from your Deck to your hand."
		=> Searches Suva and Suva Kaita, especially the latter is thematically fitting
		=> Provides more consistent Suva access for Kanohi-centric builds
		=> Even searching Level 1 Rocks in general has no crazy broken targets at the moment, Nemeses Keystone is as good as it gets in this category - shouldn't change either since generic searchers for both Level 1s and Rocks exist
		=> Rather than sending as cost, it would also possible to self-destruct in the effect so (current draft version of) Mata Nui gets triggered
		==> Kini-Nui getting destroyed and leaving behind rocks is a sneaky reference to its ultimate fate as well
		=> May be OP that you can use the extra NS and recycle for a combo, then self-destruct to get another card for further combos (while still having your regular NS) all in the same turn, so maybe make the new effect an End Phase trigger
		==> Buffing it to Special Summon instead of add would allow it to set up a Suva during your End Phase to make Kanohi in GY live
		==> Using it during your opponent's End Phase instead gives you an additional Suva/Suva Kaita during your next turn
		==> Having it happen in the End Phase enhances the aforementioned lore connection as well
		
		Observation: The combination of an extra NS and bringing any tribute back to the hand essentially makes Toa Mata a free summon in just about every deck.
		=> not what they're balanced for
		=> Toa Mata deck mostly tributes other Toa or stuff that they want in the GY (e.g. Suva), so no need for that there
		=> Koro decks already got enough value out of Toa Mata to justify using them when they used up the real Normal Summon, so they can definitely live without the recycling option
		=> Therefore: Make recycling effect limited to the SS case, while non-Toa tributes just stay in the GY

		Orig:
		When this card is Normal Summoned: You can place 1 "C.C. Matoran" monster from your Deck or Graveyard on top of your Deck. Once per turn: You can discard 1 "C.C. Matoran" monster; Look at the top 3 cards of your deck, then Special Summon as many "C.C. Matoran" monsters among them as possible. "C.C. Matoran" monsters you control cannot be selected as an attack target.
		
		Excavate just like Call of the Toa Stones, because that's a Takua thing - also represents searching for the Chronicler's Company
		=> Updated: Add the possibility of adding The Chronicler's Company to hand so a) that card is somewhat searchable b) running it gives you a chance of offseting the discard and c) there's actually some excitement when excavating with a stacked topdeck
		
		Normal Summon + eff is a 1-card combo into a Turaga for any Koro deck that runs its respective C.C. Matoran (= stacks a C.C. Matoran on Summon)
		=> takes on the Attribute because Av-Matoran
		=> Updated: Don't stack from hand because you usually have a way to get stuff out of the hand before even summoning Takua, instead stack from banished so we can recycle Hafu's targets
		==> Overly verbose wording from Denier, but without the comma before "and" so it flows better with "and if you do" (precedent?)
		==> may be too good as recycling since it's also not once per turn, so might revert later

		The enemy of Prosperity is Hunger.
		=> saps away whatever resource are needed for hard work
		=> currently would just make opponent gain LP, so not really relevant
		=> unless: hard work is reducing opponent's LP
		
		Pakari's ATK boost seems to fit in more with Ta-Koro's playstyle, though it would be redundant there.
		=> if hard work is reducing opponent's LP, a bigger beatstick would have some synergy
		Ruru currently has no relevance.
		=> maybe inflict damage based on revealed card, like Aqua Dolphin
		
		Improvement for draw effect: Just pay up to 3000 LP to draw up to 3, rather than equalizing with opponent
		=> doesn't become super inefficient when you're far ahead in LP
		=> no need to account for possible difference between LP at activation and resolution in code
		=> may or may not still require higher LP at activation

		Search something new = studying the past to avoid future problems

		=> very likely too generic (only EARTH? only EARTH Warrior?)
		=> shuffling monsters from GY back conflicts with Onu-Koro a bit (might not have enough monsters for both)
		=> More accessible version: On Link Summon, search an EARTH Warrior with a different name than everything in GY (makes up for the summon minus, so Onu-Koro wealth is not impacted)
		==> no shuffling back, because that would be stealing resources Onu-Koro needs
		=> Searching may be too good since it's only slightly more limited in targets than Isolde while lacking the whole "not this turn" restriction
		==> Instead, could send an EARTH Warrior with a different name from monsters in GY to GY, then shuffle back another (EARTH? Warrior?) monster from GY - literally learning from the mistakes of the past (not getting the right monster in GY to begin with) and providing the solution that lets you proceed in the present (by getting what you need into the GY)
		==> Total GY count remains identical, so it does not hinder Onu-Koro and may avoid being useful to Po-Koro (though any deck with GY effects can make use of dumping a specific monster, so probably not)
		==> Really good with Goukis since it lets you activate Rematch even if only 1 material was a Gouki, but does it actually synergize with the not yet existent Onu-Matoran?

		Mata Role: Extra Deck Summoning
		
		Idea: Use tokens to contribute to ED summons pretty much universally, reward successful ED summons under EARTH restriction with recycling of resources for combo purposes.
		=> Further restrictions?
		=> More specific targets for recycling effect?
		=> Make it so eff 2 has general EARTH lock for the whole turn?
		
		Principle: Creation.
		"Creation was the concept of making new things."
		=> Extra Deck Summons
		=> Possible overlap with C.C. Matoran
		=> Tokens are literally created!
		
		Creation grants Strategy.
		=> Some big brain stuff with ED monsters?
		=> Combos
		
		The enemy of Creation is Disintegration.
		=> some form of removal that hits harder against Extra Deck monsters (e.g. return to hand?)
		
		Alternative idea:
		"If a monster is Special Summoned from the Extra Deck using materials on the field, and all materials sent from the field to your GY for that Summon are EARTH Warrior monsters: You can Special Summon those monsters from the GY, but they cannot be used as material, also banish them when they leave the field. If you control no monsters: You can shuffle 1 of your banished EARTH Warrior monsters into the Deck; Special Summon 1 "Sculpture Token". You can only use each effect of "Po-Koro, Village of Stone" once per turn."
		=> More emphasis on EARTH Warriors (Po-Matoran) as "sculptors"
		=> Translates being used as material to crafting an Extra Deck monster (i.e., the crafters stay around after its finished)
		=> Second effect keeps the literal "creation" of Tokens as a recovery mechanism that also recycles the Po-Matoran banished by effect 1.
		=> Check legality of generic "material" clauses!
		==> Gnomaterial has "used as material for [...]", but explicitly lists the summoning type - so "used as material for a Special Summon from the Extra Deck" is unprecedented, but still reasonably close
		=> Maybe do "but they cannot be used as material for the same kind of Summon (sic)", to force diversification of ED types (as opposed to the Gouki Link Spam Onu-Koro does)
		
		Refined version of alternative idea, to keep with preexisting mechanics as much as possible:
		"If an EARTH Warrior monster(s) ((and no other monsters)?) is sent to your GY as material for a Fusion, Synchro, or Link Summon, or by being detached from an Xyz Monster (to activate that monster's effect?): You can Special Summon that monster(s) in face-up Defense Position, but negate its effects, also banish it when it leaves the field. For the rest of this turn, you cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck with the same monster card type as the monsters you controlled when this effect was activated."
		=> the concept of "summoning types" as a generic term seems entirely foreign to PSCT, so I probably can't make the variable material restriction work as originally intended - just a full-on summoning restriction, then
		=> Plus the token summon effect because literal creation is nice and it's a good way to get to the point where you can summon something
		=> might need some more restrictions to be fair, but if that's the case I'll probably rethink the idea because it's already wordy as hell as it is now
		==> e.g. we could just have the token summon with the restriction against resummoning the same ED type - have other cards like Onewa handle the rest of the womboing and comboing
		==> actually that sounds perfect. let's just try that first
		=> for the combo with Onewa, demanding only EARTH Warriors is a bit restrictive (since his materials just need to include 1), so maybe lower that requirement to only EARTH 
		
		Banish Rock to protect EARTH monsters
		=> works with Tokens (see Cherubini rulings), so a leftover Sculpture can work as protection
		=> "trade" banishment and destruction like they do on the bazaar
		=> not destruction/destruction trade since an effect like this for a whole attribute is pretty broad compared to what already exists - gotta be a bit more expensive, unless you use a token of course
		
		Token summon could probably get one of these two slight buffs:
		A) Allows 1 more summon of the same type this turn
		=> Onewa combo is an easy Link 4 this way, otherwise you don't really have any way to get rid of Onewa during your combo since Links can only be used for Links
		==> could also just make sure to use Po-Koro on a different summoning type so that avenue stays open - "strategy"!
		B) No once per turn, repetition is inherently limited by the summoning types becoming locked
		=> you get more tokens the more different summons you can perform
		=> could get weird if more summoning types are introduced, especially if we eventually do find some more generic wording that accomodates them too (maybe an argument against doing that?)
		=> have to carefully chose the timing where you get a token and have to switch to another summoning type - "strategy!"

		Mata Role: Protection
		
		Needs a lot of work still ...
		=> Automatic Defense Position is bad since it counters current Anger design (rather than being countered by it)
		=> Updated passive effects: Grant protection via non-aggression
		==> effective separation from Ga- because their focus on interaction on the opponent's turn would leave you vulnerable
		==> effective weakness to Anger because being forced to attack turns off battle protection during the following turn
		==> still lacking an active component
		
		Principle: Peace.
		"Those who were peaceful were focused and calm about all they did"
		=> stall?
		=> slow playstyle to contrast Ga-Koro's fast one (and also to discourage mixing Ga and Ko in WATER deck)
		=> "On Mount Ihu, nothing grows and nothing changes" => lockdown?
		
		Peace grants Willpower.
		=> "improve focus" and "gain more control"
		=> ?
		=> CONTROL!
		
		The enemy of Peace is Anger.
		=> forcing battle screws up Ko plays?
		
		v3.16.2: Slightly tweaked conditions, possibly a bit better.
		=> Moving targeting protection to the attack condition makes the wording shorter
		=> Protection is now a weaker effect, so it can have an easier condition that still allows you to bounce and spin stuff (basically "peaceful" removal), so you're more able to clear the field and full-on stall situations are less likely
		=> Drop the artificial condition to discourage effect damage, because with Wave-Motion Cannon you can make a stall/burn strategy without ever needing to deal damage before you've won anyway
		
		AI really can't deal with attack prevention, so as a further anti-stall tweak, maybe change that part to something like "If you did not declare an attack during the last turn, monsters your opponent controls that were not face-up on the field during your last Standby Phase cannot attack"
		=> does targeting protection still make sense in this branch then?
		=> "If you did not declare an attack during the last turn, monsters your opponent controls cannot attack, unless they were face-up on the field and did not declare an attack during your opponent's last Battle Phase"
		==> Allows you to stall for just a single turn in emergencies even against an established board

		{{Pay 500 LP to equip a Kanohi to a Toa}}
		{{Special Summon "Suva"}}
		
		Another alternative way to not have the requip effect on every single Toa.
		
		Hole in strategy: How to get on field after tributing?
		
		Variant A:
		You can reveal this card and 1 "Toa Mata" monster in your hand; this card's attribute becomes that other monster's attribute, until the end of this turn. Once per Chain (Quick Effect): You can target 1 face-up "Toa Mata" monster you control; equip 1 "Kanohi" Equip Spell Card from your hand or GY to that target, except a card that is in the GY because it was destroyed while face-up on the field and sent there this turn.
		
		Variant B:
		Pictured
		=> supports all Toa rather than just Mata because Kanohi-switching could always be relevant, and even with the Mata you want it to work on the Kaita as well
		=> multi-attribute effect only goes in effect on field, so without a field spell you can't efficiently tribute this for a Toa Mata, which limits consistency
		==> permanent multi-attribute? - no precedent for a Level 1 with that, possibly too much secondary utilty
		===> should be fine if it's just in hand
		==> on-demand attribute change in hand and on field? - should work, but wordy
		=> non-OPT SS procedure means this would be an instant OTK with cards like Cannon Soldier, so maybe avoid that
		==> hard to get rid of if you have a Toa anyway, so summoning once per turn should be enough
		=> a card with more than 3 effects already feels like a bit of a clusterfuck, so an attempt was made to cut this down to the most important 3 by cutting the protection
		==> Problem A: No protection, so you can easily lose your Suva, but your opponent also has to expend resources to achieve this and you can get it back during your turn if you have a Toa - experiment to see if this is sufficient
		==> Problem B: No attribute adjustment on field, so it could interfere with Koro strategies - maybe make it so it takes the attribute of the targeted Toa when Kanohi swapping (but then you might be forced into an unnecessary swap just so your Koro isn't dead) or on summon
		===> or just make the continuous adjustment work on field if you have a Koro - looks a bit weird in text, but perfectly and exactly solves the issue
		
		The general idea is that a Suva in Defense Position should act like a continouous Spell/Trap that can also be destroyed by battle (the only real reason it's a monster is so you can tribute it for the Toa). This works without any special protection, except in the presence of piercing or battle position changing effects, where the card is instead a huge liability.
		=> adding a small protection effect to negate battle damage would fix this

		{{Banish added Spell/Trap(s)}}
		{{Add Kopaka to hand}}
		
		Piercing damage got added to the Pakari, so we need something else here. Suggestion: Hand reveal.
		=> Existing cards commonly associate light with revealing set cards, while hand reveals are associated with mind reading and straight up cheating
		=> X-Ray Vision "looking through" cards in hand is a straightforward imaginary cheating situation, so we can arguably apply that mechanic here
		=> Making unaffected is a bonus to achieve a suitable powerlevel for a Great Kanohi and fits in with Kaukau/Miru for the Rua
		==> Currently redundant with Kaukau and Miru because together they already make the monster fully unaffected, but if that changes to something like destruction and targeting protection this could be handy to deal with any remaining outs.
		=> Problem with locking drawn card: Doesn't necessarily do anything, Kanohi swapping undoes the lock
		==> Alt.: "Once per turn, if your opponent draws a card(s): You can activate this effect; for the rest of this turn while you control this face-up card, your opponent plays with their hand revealed, also banish 1 card from their hand until the End Phase."
		===> Banishing has definite impact even after Kanohi is swapped, hand reveal is secondary but still represents the ongoing X-Ray vision ability
		===> Card to banish is choosable so you can go after Ko-Koro threates - maybe random would be more fair?
		===> Requires opponent drawing as trigger, so can't just easily do hand check turn 1
		==> Or: "If another "Kanohi" card is equipped to the equipped monster, destroy this card. If this card is sent to the GY: You can banish 1 monster from your GY; add 1 "Toa Mata Kopaka" from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of "Great Kanohi Akaku" once per turn. While equipped to a "Toa" or "Makuta" monster you control, this card gains these effects.
		*Your opponent must play with their hand revealed.
		*Once per turn, if a Spell/Trap is added to your opponent's hand (except during the Damage Step): You can make the equipped monster lose 500 ATK, and if you do, banish that Spell/Trap until the End Phase."
		==> Similar payoff, but with continuous hand reveal because if Mind on Air isn't broken, an equip spell that only works with certain Level 6 and/or Ritual monsters probably won't be either
		==> "Sniping" a Spell/Trap (because Ko-Koro synergy) out of the opponent's hand could be said to represent the other vision enhancements like zooming provided by the additional lenses, and reduces ATK because due to the focus it takes
		==> Really pushing the length boundaries again (ATK reduction is actually permanent because I cut the "until the end of this turn" there), would be nice if that can be shortened
		===> An ATK reduction as cost is basically just symbolic anyway, so might as well leave out all those words and just banish, short and crisp

		{{Send Level 1 Rock from Deck to GY}}
		{{Tribute to Special Summon 1 FIRE and 1 EARTH "Toa Mata"}}
		{{Halve the ATK/DEF of 1 monster your opponent controls?}}
		
		Considerations for overhaul of Toa Mata combinations:
		=> help with qualities like consistency and recoverability, since main deck Toa Mata don't explicitly interact
		=> ideally, abilities of the participants should have visible influence in the combination's effect
		=> maybe also try to trigger the corresponding Toa Mata effects (e.g. Magma triggers Onua by sending a Toa to GY and has high ATK so it might trigger Tahu by battle)
		=> Idea to encourage using the matching attributes of Toa Mata: "During the Standby Phase: You can tribute this card, then target 2 Level 6 "Toa Mata" monsters in your GY (1 FIRE monster and 1 EARTH monster); Special Summon those targets."
		==> Or during End Phase, or as a floating effect on destroy/banish by opponent's card (would be a bit of a nerf)
		==> Maybe put some restriction on those monsters like not being able to use them for an Xyz Summon until the end of X turn
		==> Lets you use the Combination effect and then make the triggers of the Toa Mata used as material live again, but only if you used the right attributes (or already had them in the GY)
		==> A more powerful approach: "(Quick Effect): You can Tribute this card with no Xyz Materials, then target ..."
		===> Use up combination, then tag out into the appropriate materials
		===> Can be used to dodge some disruptions after activating the main effect by detaching the last material
		===> Lets you fetch the triggers you need after your opponent performs an action
		===> Helps make the Kaita with Kini-Nui: Tribute a Combination, bring it back with no materials, tag out into 2 Toa Mata, and you have 3 materials ready to go
		===> Avoids the confusing case where the only appropriate targets to revive are the attached materials and you thus can't activate the effect unless there are already other targets in the GY
		
		Detach effect: Detach 2 materials to set up a Suva (Kaita) in the GY and search a Spell/Trap
		=> archetypal ones (Call, Coming) or Kanohi (only Great so we don't get access to legendaries this way)
		=> The Suva part I'm sure about, but the search is still kinda random...
		==> maybe something to harm the opponent so it fits the "explosive power of a volcano"?
		===> But unless it's just boring old burn, that would be a problem to use turn 1, and we do want the Suva setup (though the second part could be optional I guess)
		===> something like ATK reduction or changing to face-down Defense would go well with Tahu, but does that have enough impact to justify the 2 material cost?
		==> or just something basic like a draw as the second payoff? (boooring)
		
		Tag-out effect is usable on the next turn after detaching the materials due to shared OPT
		=> does it still need to summon in Defense or at least prevent the monsters from attacking?
		=> Fastest combination to make the tagout available to the double detach on the ignition effect
		==> If we replace the shared OPT with something like "can*t special summon magma for the rest of the turn" or just a general "can only special summon Magma once per turn", it could even show up, fire its effect, and then tag out, so that would let us get away with a relatively weak detach effect
		===> also goes with the "explosive power" thing....

		{{Add Level 4 or lower EARTH monster from GY}}
		{{Special Summon banished EARTH Warrior}}
		
		Idea: Trigger on Token Summon from Po-Koro to bring back banished "sculptors", obviously has different uses as well.
		=> Negate effects of Summoned monster?
		==> Nah, we want to be able to trigger Hafu
		=> Treat summoned monster as a Tuner? Then the combo with Po-Koro would work perfectly without requiring specific other cards.
		==> would increase utility in most cases, but specifically when triggering off Halq going into Locusts on the opponent's turn you wouldn't be able to quick synch by getting some fitting non-tuner
		==> maybe only if you control a Rock or specifically a Sculpture Token?
		==> Balance: Precedent for making fairly arbitrary other monsters treated as Tuners with similarly accessible effects (e.g. Aromage Laurel), but none in the Extra Deck yet
		
		Draw + banish: Set up SS effect in absence of Po-Koro
		=> "fairness" - both players do the same thing
		=> proven to not be very good in practice, as the opponent potentially ends up with extra resources and your draw might not be something that lets you continue your plays
		=> Alternative idea: "You can banish 1 EARTH monster from your GY, then target 1 EARTH monster in your GY; add that target to your hand, then banish 1 card from your hand, then, if your opponent has more total cards in their hand or field than you do, draw 1 card"
		==> only you get resources, fairness lies in that it only lets you plus if you're behind
		==> guaranteed to get back a monster which has a higher chance of getting something you can still SS than a fully random draw
		==> Problem A: Might not always have two EARTH monsters in GY to banish and return to hand
		===> Require one of them to be Rock/Warrior instead?
		==> Problem B: Long and complicated texts with TWO thens, one of them conditional
		===> Might want other conjunctions than then or other ordering, right now adding back an ED monster would execute neither the banishing nor the draw - may or may not be desirable
		==> Next version: "You can banish 1 monster from your GY, then target 1 Level 4 or lower EARTH monster in your GY; the player who has fewer total cards in their hand and field draws 1 card, also, add that target to your hand, and if you do, banish 1 card from your hand."
		===> first part could also be phrased "the player with the lowest total number of cards in their hand and field draws 1 card" - clearer in hypothetical formats with >2 players, but requires "number of cards"
		===> Problem A is fixed by letting the cost banish be any monster, so now Link Summoning Onewa always gives you at least 1 shot of the effect (assuming you used a Level 4 or lower EARTH monster)
		====> Banishing arbitrary monsters from GY is for some reason a very rare cost, so maybe a different approach would be better?
		====> Double banish turns on Keystone, but turns off all revival-based SS methods assuming minimal grave setup - seems like a bad trade, so maybe cut the banish cost entirely?
		=====> DB air testing makes this seem like a good move, so implemented
		===> Problem B is fixed by putting the conditional part first and adjusting it so it's perfectly clear the rest is independent from the condition, also got rid of the "then" entirely since it just makes timing more complicated
		===> Other improvements #1: Fairness condition now makes it so the effect is a +1 when you're behind (draw 1, add 1 from GY, banish 1 => +1+1-1=+1), a -1 when you're ahead (opponent draws 1, add 1 from GY, banish 1 => -1+1-1=-1), and neutral when both are equal (neither draws (see e.g. Chicken Game's no damage clause), add 1 from GY, banish 1 => +1-1=0). This way the potential draw every turn is balanced by the effect being potentially harmful in other situations, and it's still a good recovery tool (especiall with Komau revive).
		===> Other improvements #2: New ordering and conjunctions make it so returning a monster to the Extra Deck still gets the draw, but doesn't need to banish - seems reasonable. Also, limiting the targets to Level 4 or lower makes it pretty unlikely it will be used on an ED monster anyway.
		===> BUT IT'S STILL SO FUCKING LONG

		=> Upgrade Kanohi searches to straight up SS
		=> target and reveal both in cost to avoid ambiguous situations where you activate this card targeting some Kanohi, but only get the appropriate monster into hand between activation and resolution - look up how that works (probably shouldn't be legal to activate in that case)
		=> Maybe even equip Kanohi from GY (but in that case with stricter cost/condition)
		
		First effect: replicates NS equip effect of original Toa Mata, probably a more reliable way of searching than requiring battle destruction.
		=> could also be triggered "When a "Toa (Mata?)" monster is Normal Summoned, or Special Summoned by the effect of a "Toa" card"
		
		Second effect could also be something that gives a reward (e.g. a draw) for completing the "quest" by having a certain number of Kanohi in the GY.
		=> Maybe summon a banished monster, since you're likely to have quite a few after fiddling around with so many Kanohi

		Original:
		Target up to 3 Level 4 or lower monsters in your Graveyard that were destroyed this turn; Special Summon 1 "Toa" monster with the same Attribute from your hand or Deck for each of these monsters. Monsters Special Summoned by this effect cannot attack during the turn they are Summoned. If this face-down card is destroyed by your opponent's card effect and sent to the Graveyard: You can destroy all monsters you control (min. 1); Special Summon 1 "Toa" monster from your hand or Deck. You can only activate 1 "Coming of the Toa" effect per turn, and only once that turn
		
		Keep the on-destruction effect or can we live without that crutch now?
		=> Could search Quest for the Masks as a secondary effect (e.g. during End Phase after getting sent to the GY, whether activated or removed), so we get a little Call->Coming->Quest chain going
		=> Another approach would be to have the return to hand and the Quest search happen simultaneously, so you get it as a reward for actually having the Toa stay on the field that long and also have some summons to trigger Quest set up right away
		
		Generic Toa support or only Toa Mata?
		=> SS restriction needs to be generic because of Toa Kaita
		=> Might actually be too good to have exceptions from the restriction, can be an instant Kaita on your turn just from having this card set and a few random monsters in the GY
		
		Temporary outcome up to +3 Toa on field, permanent outcome up to +3 Toa in hand
		=>With Toa Mata, can set up appropriate triggers at the appropriate time
		=> multiple Toa Mata in hand automatically means  at least one is summonable
		=> too much plus or is it fine because it's a conditional trap?

		{{Tribute to Special Summon a Level 6 "Toa" from GY}}
		{{Banish to Special Summon a banished "Toa"}}
		{{Affected by "Suva Kaita": Cannot Special Summon from Extra Deck, except "Toa" monsters}}
		
		If other cards are sufficient to summon multiple Toa, maybe make this aid Kaita with something like letting a Toa Mata be treated as 2 materials?
		<soft-line>
		GY eff: Also replace with something relevant to Kaita?
		
		Latest idea after testing Toa Mata deck with Suva and Kini-Nui: Recovery tool to bring back Toa from GY/banished.
		=> tribute to SS from GY - no strong restrictions, targets readily available, requires summoning Suva Kaita first and only replaces it with a Toa
		==> make it a quick effect so it can be used to set up a Toa Mata's trigger effect exactly when needed, and provides an immediate play when summoned via Kini-Nui in your End Phase
		=> banish from GY to SS banished -  locks SS for the rest of the turn, targets need to set up with e.g. Kanohi, can be used whenever Suva Kaita is in GY (including right after using the first effect)
		==> allow Toa in general here, so you can bring back a Combination and use its tagout to assemble Kaita materials
		=> Both effects being usable in one turn is intentional, to offer the ability to go from just one Suva Kaita to a rank 6 provided GY and banished are set up properly - important for comebacks, may of course be overkill
		=> SS restriction affecting only the Extra Deck and working for the whole turn (not just the rest) would also make sense, since that way it still doesn't prevent summoning Suva Kaita itself
		==> ended up going with Extra Deck only for the rest of the turn only - anything else would probably be overkill when you only get a single monster and need setup
		=> May want it to only work on "Toa Mata" or Level 6 or lower "Toa" - reviving Nuva that easily probably isn't a good idea
		=> Maybe also negate the effects of the summoned monsters, destroy/banish them at the end of the turn, ... to make it clear that making a Rank 6 (Kaita) is the main goal
		==> Negating effects would be stupid fo the GY revive since you want to take advantage of trigger timings, and banish revive is probably already sufficiently restricted
		==> Could make GY revive banish at the end of your/the next turn so you definitely get an opportunity to overlay still, but text seems long enough already, so let's only do that if really needed
		=> Maybe add an activation condition (control no other monsters, control no "Toa" monsters (like in the old version)) to first effect
		
		Follow the Suva's lead in being treated as all non-DARK attributes in the hand (for Toa Mata summons) and GY (for Coming)
		=> no need for on-field since you're not meant to use this in a Koro deck anyway (Suva Kaita is at Kini-Nui!)</soft-line>

	notes:
		Spell version because having a trap as a consistency booster probably wouldn't work very well for the deck
		
		Since it excavates (because the Toa being called are still in the future), the logic here is that a higher number of hits implies more Toa still in the Deck and therefore less in hand/GY. So:
		=> 0 gives you a Suva/Suva Kaita to do something with the Toa you presumably already have
		==> could theoretically be abused as a generic searcher in an (not yet existing) archetype with appropriate targets, though it would still be a -1
		=> 3 gives you a Coming (maybe even "can be activated during this turn"?) so you can quickly fetch all those Toa in your Deck
		=> 1 / 2 do something inbetween, but what?
		=> Check if it's still a good idea to have the >0 effects cumulative once the new ones are all done
		=> Also do some math on probabilities of getting each effect to figure out how to balance them
		
		Alternative effects (with broader grouping):
		* 0: Add 1 Level 1 Rock monster with 0 ATK/DEF from your Deck to your hand.
		* 1+: Add 1 of those monsters to your hand.
		* 3+: Special Summon 1 of those monsters.
		* 6: You can set 1 "Coming of the Toa" directly from your Deck. It can be activated during this turn.
		
		Or add directly from the excavated cards (maybe more straightforward):
		"Discard 1 card; excavate the top 6 cards of your Deck,  and if you do, you can add up to 2 excavated "Toa Mata" monsters with different names to your hand, also shuffle the rest into the Deck. Also, apply this effect, depending on the number of cards added. You can only activate 1 "Call of the Toa Stones" per turn.
		*0: Set 1 "Coming of the Toa" directly from your Deck. It can be activated this turn.
		*1: Add 1 Level 1 Rock monster with 0 ATK/DEF from your Deck to your hand.
		*2: Gain 2000 LP."
		=> 0 means they're probably deeper in the Deck, so get Coming to make up for the -2 if you can just get something in the GY (e.g. with the discard cost)
		=> adding 1 means you might not have a second, so get a Suva as guaranteed tribute fodder (=> +0)
		=> adding 2 means you're ready to summon at least 1, so just give an LP boost as a reward, kinda callback to the old damage protection effect (and it's still +0)
		=> could also have "Discard 1 card, then roll a six-sided die; excavate cards from the top of your Deck equal to the result" if we want a bit of gambling

		Trader and Traitor - coincidence? Yeah, probably
		Takes your opponent's side through an even exchange of Special Summons, but will easily betray his current controller
		=> SS from hand can trigger effects like Hafu
		=> control change acts as handtrap insurance - even if opponent uses Ash/Veiler/etc, you end up with an extra monster through the switch
		=> make changing control once per turn? As it is, you need to use Ahkmou immediately for a summon or somethign before he betrays you again, which is kind of fitting
		==> that's fine and also gives you a way to set up the insurance again if you have other extenders, but to ensure it doesn't lead to any weird chain situations, it needs to be a trigger effect rather than a quick one - as per Yuki-Onna rulings, you're only allowed to activate it once after a chain with multiple triggers resolves

		{{Flip monsters face-down to bounce}}
		
		Quasi-remove stuff without impacting Ko-Koro's protection
		=> Unwilling to talk to anyone who isn't patient, so monsters have to wait a turn before coming face-to-face with him again
		=> Flip your own monsters face-down too because bird language = penguin synergy har har
		=> Might not even need soft OPT, but just to be safe?
		=> If Ko-Koro allows bouncing, could be improved to "Once per turn: You can target 1 monster your opponent controls; change 1 monster you control to face-down Defense Position, and if you do, return that target to the hand."
		==> shorter, actually gets stuff off the field and works on links
		==> even more penguin-like because it simultaenously sets them up and does the bouncing they're known for
		=> opponent's monster is targeted because it is removal, after all
		=> Optional: "This card cannot attack during the turn you activate this effect." - as a further restriction that is mostly irrelevant in proper Ko-Koro decks, just in case this is too strong
		
		Plus some kind of WATER (Warrior) support?
		=> Maybe something similar to Vakama since he also has visions as a Turaga?
		
		Lingering protection effect on another card = looking towards the future
		=> Makes a mean lock with Ko-Koro since you can't remove Ko-Koro without removing Nuju who you can't remove without removing Ko-Koro
		=> Even better would be to target both a WATER monster (possibly Nuju himself) and another card you control so that the first target protects the second (attribute support + future planning also involves deciding which of your monsters will survive best), but the phrasing for that is hella tricky - should avoid picking the same card for both targets
		==>  Limiting to face-up S/T solves that nicely, suits the primary use case, and keeps the risk of unwanted generic usefulness fairly low
		=> v3.16.3: Rather than re-enabling protection every EP, apply it once per Special Summon - we want to discourage long stall situations anyway and activating the effect all the time gets annoying
		==> As a little buff in exchange, protection condition now just requires any WATER monster, which conveniently also simplifies the text a lot

		=> Level 2 Warrior pool isn't nearly good enough to justify the downside here, so let's just make putting the searched card on top of the deck an option in order to potentially enable that combo with Takua
		==> happy medium: put card on top of deck iff you searched a non-WATER monster, so Ko-Koro (once it has enough Matoran) gets its easy Nuju route and C.C.dek can set up Takua and maybe put back a garnet for Isolde

		=> Doing battle damage instead of effect damage will preserve Ko-Koro protection, as will attacking directly instead of getting monsters out of the way

		=> Could maybe also include some element of returning something to the hand, as in telekinetically retrieving it?

		=> v3.16.3: Redesigned in a different direction from inflicting damage, instead "telekinetically" changing battle positions (without targeting)
		==> Cannot flip monsters face-down because that's too close to non-targeting removal to be allowed on a Noble Kanohi

		{{Special Summon a "Toa Mata" from Deck}}
		{{Tribute to Special Summon 1 WIND and 1 WATER "Toa Mata"}}
		
		Sticking with the original "storm of summons/effects" concept, but now it straight up fetches any Toa Mata from deck since we need the extra flexibility to exploit the correct triggers
		=> attack and ED summon restrictions hopefully cancel out any benefits of summoning from the deck beyond gaining the effect
		==> Fusion is still allowed, just to make Toa Nuva even better
		=> low stats are now no longer boosted by materials, this effect alone should be worth the downgrade
		==> but change to different low stats, 2000+ ATK is useful as a sneaky way to mark Toa
		=> summoning Toa Mata from Deck and bouncing them during EP kinda overlaps with what Coming of the Toa does (just on a smaller scale), so maybe adjust one of these two
		=> maybe banish in EP instead of bounce (sets up Suva Kaita)
		==> banish during EP of NEXT turn, so you can summon one during your turn and have its trigger available during your opponent's
		=> being a QE lines up with Gali's trigger, summoning from Deck lines up with Lewa's
		
		Tag-out effect might still need some extra restrictions (no non-Toa SS? can't SS with just those two? banish self instead of tributing? can't special summon "Storm" for the rest of the turn? shared OPT so you need to wait a turn after using last material?)
		=> SS lock on "Storm" seems clever, but text becomes dangerously long with that
		=> banish or shared OPT don't need much more words, so those might be the most elegant options

		Le-Koro concept is about being able to make a comeback with minimal resources (as opposed to Onu-Koro ensuring you always have ample resources), so Matau helps that by giving you an extra summon on an empty field and floating into recyclign a WIND
		=> Adjust targets for these depending on what other cards are available
		=> Testing suggests that requiring an empty field for the summon fucks up a lot of good plays (including using Matau's summon to trigger Lewa's bounce), so the drawback is now instead making the ATK 0, which fits with Le-Koro
		==> summon it "as a joke" because prankster (is this a stretch?)
		=> floating effect shouldn't be used for immediate combo payoffs, so delay it until the own next SP, right before the potential comeback it's meant for
		==> also get a bonus draw if your back's against the wall, because Turaga Matau shines in times of crisis
		===> maybe "if you control no monsters" would be the more fitting condition?
		===> could also be something like negating an opponent's monsters effects to easily take care of disruption (which could be seen as a "prank"), but that may be OP in this kind of delayed non-targeting fashion
		==> should we target the monster to add to hand on activation?
		===> kinda seems more correct, also you could say we have "Faith" that it's still going to be there next SP

		Instead of floating when used as any material, revive self on "C.C. Matoran" summon
		=> works as before if you're using Hafu
		=> also helps the recovery aspect of Le-Koro since you get an extra body as long as you have another Tamaru to summon
		==> maybe trigger on "Matoran" summon in general to increase future utility?
		=> some kind of penalty for revive?
		==> go to bottom of Deck, as Tamaru is a bottom-dwelling type of Le-Matoran :)
		=> turns out triggering off summons has negative synergy with Le-Koro (even if it worked from the hand, you'd miss the trigger if you get Tamaru off the search)
		==> Activates at your own convenience instead whenever you control a small Warrior, which is automatically given by Le-Koro reducing ATK to 0
		===> doing that for free seems risky even with the penalty, so lets include an arbitrary discard cost for now and hope the strategy accomodates that
		
		Self-bounce to summon and maybe trigger another "C.C. Matoran", pretty much unchanged
		=> only Hafu has an SS trigger in the new version, so this probably isn't really needed anymore
		=> instead, go with the theme of buffing C.C. Matoran by self-bouncing to allow direct attacks (= conquering the fear of heights to make a path for them)
		==> weird phrasing with "also" so it still works even if we have the leave field redirect active

		Fun Fact: Makani is the Hawaiian word for "Wind" and also the name of one of the Elementsabers
		
		Tuner because Music?
		
		Plays music to welcome guests in Le-Koro, so on summon SS a Matoran of any attribute from hand
		=> on summon so it can be chained to Le-Koro search and resolve before the negate hits
		=> a possible combo for this would be NS Makani, SS Takua, Takua SS Tamaru, Takua + Tamaru -> Isolde, Isolde SS second Tamaru/Makani, Tamaru/Makani + Makani -> Matau or a Synchro, can also get Tamaru from GY as a 3rd monster at the cost of a discard
		=> with Le-Koro active as well, another Tamaru can be searched from Makani's summon and SS itself, which comes out to 4 monsters or a Level 8 Synchro (though with a WIND lock from Le-Koro)
		
		GY effect to replenish resources on subsequent turn just goes along with general Le-Koro theme.
		=> if Matau stays on the ploos route, maybe this one could be something that helps breaking boards instead?

		Since the other combinations mostly help set up the main deck Toa Mata, maybe this one should provide an actual payoff to keep on the field - such as a S/T negate
		=> anything an ED monster does satisfies Pohatu's trigger condition while Kopaka literally cannot be triggered by our own cards unless we get super fancy, so let's instead merge aspects of their respective effects here (Pohatu: S/T hate; Kopaka: banish)
		=> effect can be used with 1 or 2 materials for extra flexibility with Kaita Kanohi's double material effect
		==> first material to banish (but card still resolves, so only good against continuous cards and those with GY effects)
		==> second material to also negate
		==> since the Kaita Kanohi can't actually do double materials and as of 3.18.1 instead cheat out an extra material, we can just simplify this and always do the 2-mat negate+banish
		
		ATK buffed to 2000 for same reason as Storm
		==> maybe bump DEF to 2800 as well so it can wall as good as Beatrice
		
		Maybe also add some kind of blanket protection for your other monsters/cards, just like Kopaka sucks up attacks?

		{{Special Summon from hand, then Xyz Summon}}
		
		Basic idea is to have 3 effects (after the standard Kanohi self-destruct)
		=> make Toa usable as 2 Xyz Materials for easier Kaita/Combination access
		==> Big Problem: Only precedent is anime cards which are currently scripted with a fixed effect code, so it would be very inelegant
		==> Could do something like Exorsisters where an activated effect lets you fake an Xyz Summon, but that means more text, especially if we need to distinguish between Kaita and combinations (we absolutely do)
		==> Text is already a bit too long as is, so this might end up being cut, which would have implications for the Xyz designs as well...
		===> For now, cut it and see how the whole thing works in testing
		===> maybe there's some other way to make these not bricks?
		====> could do what has been done to adapt the anime cards for the real game and make it SS a Toa from hand or GY and then force an Xyz Summon so it's actually used as intended
		====> just from hand, then we can save on words by leaving out the HOPT and still not have a huge risk of loops
		====> might also be fine to do from hand or GY with soft OPT and the requirement to use the summoned monster for the insta-Xyz, then we can also leave out the effect negation (since nothing would trigger mid-resolution anyway)
		====> Maybe only Toa Mata, since this Kanohi is unique to their team?
		====> All of these changes are perfectly okay in length
		=> grant Toa Kaita the combined mask powers
		==> leave out the no battle damage part to save some words without losing anything super relevant (you're trying to OTK with Akamai anyway)
		=> equip to the appopriate Kaita from GY when its SS'd
		==> probably redundant since we have an easily searchable Suva (and eventually also Gift of the Shrine)
		==> cut this one if we want an anti-brick effect instead

		{{Send 1 "Turaga" moster from your Deck or Extra Deck to the GY}}
		{{Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Matoran" monster}}
		
		Basically the same idea, but on a Link-3 instead of a Field Spell to give Turaga a dedicated link climbing option
		=> no need to support Amaja-Nui on Mata Nui or such this way
		=> Problem: Le-Koro would be one of the biggest beneficiaries here, except the village itself prevents summoning this even if its effect would make it WIND once on the field...
		==> Maybe make Le-Koro lock you into WIND monster effects instead, that also has precedent
		
		Takes on the Attribute of Turaga in use, so in a Koro deck it's always the correct attribute (unless the material gets banished or something) and in a multi-attribute deck it potentially covers everything, also enhancing its effects
		
		Summoning a Warrior is the equivalent to the Field Spell's Turaga-Swapping - since being able to add a warrior of the correct attribute effectively makes anything else on your field a 1-mat Turaga
		=> original swap wouldn't have worked because you have to use your Turaga as material for this Amaja-Nui
		=> what this doesn't help you do is make a Turaga of an entirely new Attribute, so maybe rethink that once more
		=> Updated: The Noble Kanohi cost meant that the card was useless after making Isolde in a Koro deck where you usually only have 1 Noble Kanohi, so that's gone now. Also, Special Summon from banished instead of hand for better utility (which means it now targets).
		==> Noble Kanohi cost moved to Turaga Nui instead, so a deck focused on that still has a reason to run them other than the revival and a way to get rid of them other than Isolde
		==> To counterbalance these improvements, you can now only SS Matoran, not Warriors in general
		==> Other options: Negate the summoned monster's effects (bad because it prevents things like the sick Takua/Kapura/Vakama combo in a Turaga spam deck), add a different real cost like discarding or tributing (do we usually have the resources to spare?), lock special summons to Turaga in some way (a bit longer in text than I would like, also what level of lock would be appropriate?) 
		
		Floats into a Noble Kanohi in GY and a Token to Tribute off for it, just like the Field Spell
		=> could effectively be merged with the main ignition effect by simply giving that the Noble Kanohi cost
		==> did that, so no secondary effect for now, maybe there's something reasonably short that becomes apparent as a useful addition in testing
		
		Alternate secondary effect tailor-made for Turaga Nui turbo: Dump a Turaga from Deck or Extra Deck on summon
		=> sets up Turaga Nui from Main Deck
		=> can also be used to give itself an additional attribute by dumping a not yet summoned Turaga from the Extra ("gathering" the Turaga at Amaja-Nui)

		{{Special Summon Level 4 or lower Warrior from hand}}
		{{Special Summon and negate opponent's field}}
		
		Climbing into a Link-4 with only Turaga seems kind of tricky since they're not really meant to be used together (and using the Link-3 Amaja-Nui breaks the archetype chain) and also doesn't reflect it being a combination of 6 Turaga, so here's another approach similar to the old idea.
		
		Effect 1 helps with making Turaga, especially for Attributes that lack Warriors
		=> Could also make it cheaper by just revealing (maybe also from the ED so you can directly go for the Turaga you're trying to make?) rather than Tributing, but in that case it would lock you into only Turaga at least while it's on the field when Special Summoned this way
		=> Even simpler alternative would be just discarding itself to get a Warrior of a certain Attribute, but that might be better on the Matoran Nui
		=> Updated: In moving over functionality from Amaja-Nui, this effect has been changed to instead send itself from hand and a Noble Kanohi from Deck to GY as cost to summon a Warrior from hand
		==> not having an easy way to SS Turaga Nui means we can get away with the original beefy DEF and don't need any SS lock to prevent Rank 9 plays or whatever
		
		Effect 2 is the payoff for actually going through the whole Turaga lineup, just a full field negate that triggers from the GY
		=> Summons the Turaga Nui because now it has officially been made (and gives your opponent a window to banish it from the field, for fairness)
		=> Can be reused every damn turn because you sure deserve it once you get that far

		"You must control this many face-up "C.C. Matoran" monsters to activate and resolve the following effects:
		*1+: Once per turn: You can Special Summon 1 "C.C. Matoran" monster from your hand, Deck or Graveyard.
		*2+: Once per turn: "C.C. Matoran" monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.
		*3+: If a "C.C Matoran" monster(s) you control is sent to the Graveyard: Draw 1 card.
		*4+: Once per turn: You can target 1 "C.C. Matoran" monster you control and 1 card your opponent controls; return both targets to the hand.
		*5: You can send this card to the Graveyard; destroy all cards on the field, except "C.C. Matoran" cards. You can only activate this effect of "The Chronicler's Company" once per turn."
		
		Trimmed down to the most relevant effects at the 1, 3, and 6 steps (which is actually possible in MR4+ :D), with some buffs where needed
		=> 1+ effect lets you easily set up additional company members like Kapura or Kopeke for their continuous buffs to the ED monsters made via Hafu
		==> Updated: Can only summon monsters you don't control yet, since we want to set up ADDITIONAL members, and the synergy of making something with Hafu and then getting him back plus another monster (for 3 total) is a bit over the top
		=> 3+ is simple, straightforward disruption
		==> maybe banish (temporarily) instead of bouncing?
		==> Updated: Once per turn added, return "them" rather than "those targets" to simplify resolution checks
		===> the missing OPT was an accidental oversight that might actually have been cool to leave in, except the card being chainable to itself sucks, and adding some kind of activation condition to elegantly prevent that probably loses more utility than being able to use it multiple times per turn gains
		=> 6 is a total field nuke that now shuffles instead of destroying, and is no longer HOPT because you send the card to the GY anyway
		==> Updated: Now unrespondable so you get a real big payoff for assembling a full board of 6

		● LIGHT/DARK: Target 1 Level 2 monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target."
		
		Updated version should probably make this a QE for extra flexibility since the payoffs aren't that great, but do we even want to use the same approach?
		=> individual effects adjusted to somehow align with their Koro's playstyle
		==> though you probably wouldn't make this in a Koro deck since it's off-Attribute and can't use its full potential without materials of varied Attributes
		=> could be further buffed by letting you detach multiple (up to 3?) at once to get all the effects
		==> doing that on summon introduces the interesting dynamic where you really only get the full payoff when using 3 different attributes, and you can also intentionally keep one around for the battle protection
		=> alternative approach may include taking on the materials' attributes (plus maybe some continuous effects depending on what is attached), but then it becomes very similar to Numer 76 ...

		Same idea as Turaga Nui - provide a bit of utiltiy while assembling the necessary pieces, and then reward completing that with some kind of great payoff
		=> payoff rather TODO in this case, right now it's just the 2.5k body
		=> Updated: Now the utility effect helps you quickly find a lot of your Matoran, but only in a multi-Attribute deck (which is the only place the Matoran Nui canonically makes sense anyway); the payoff was improved with a pop as part of the summon because when a Matoran Nui is made it's usually to smash something
		==> pop is limited to monsters so there's an easy way to make an upgrade for full-power Matoran Nui, stats reduced for the same reason
