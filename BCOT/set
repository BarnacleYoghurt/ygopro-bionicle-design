		{{Normal Summon by Tributing from hand}}
		{{Reduce ATK to 0}}
		{{Equip Kanohi from hand or GY}}
		{{FAIYAAAAAAAAAAAH!}}
		
		Already has overhaul effects.
		
		Further overhaul should do the following:
		-) Feasible boss monster for Ta-Koro deck
		-) Feasible part of a multi-Toa deck (Kaita or even all six)
		-) Depict the process of being lost in the ocean for a long time before finally coming to rescue the Matoran somehow (e.g. SS condition that requires (FIRE) monsters in your GY and opponent to control monsters)
		
		General Toa Mata effect structure:
		1) Allow Tributes from hand (maybe with some restriction like not attacking the turn it's summoned like that?)
		2) Effect supporting the Koro's playstyle
		3) Kanohi cycling
		
		For Tahu, 2) does ATK reduction to help with battle. Could also be a continuous effect, or only trigger on own summon (but be more powerful), or do burn damage when a FIRE monster destroys a monster by battle, or do something on attack declaration (could be safely activated in combination with Hau, since Tahu can then just attack whatever) ...
		Maybe: "Once per turn, when a monster you control gains ATK: You can make all monsters your opponent controls lose the same amount of ATK." Downside: Doesn't activate on own summon.
		
		Alt 2): Once per turn, before damage calculation: ... (more flexible)
		
		
		Problem with fancy new Kanohi equipping effect: Link Isolde, send 6 Kanohi, Special Summon Toa --> any 2 Warriors equal a nearly free Toa Mata able to cycle through the full ass of protection and buffs
		=> too easy, especially since the key card is entirely unrelated to the archetype
		=> on the other hand, running 6 different Kanohi is a gimmick deck anyway, so maybe Isolde enabling that isn't too bad
		=> but Golden Kanohi should definitely be changed
		
		Usability issue with swap effect returning Kanohi: Since each return is from a separate effect, YGOPro asks to resolve each separately in EP.
		=> lots of clicks if lots of swaps happened
		=> Current solution: Each Toa returns all of their own banished Kanohi at once, but this might not be the proper handling for this mechanic, since technically each resolution of the effect only establishes that the Kanohi banished in that particular resolution is returned. The difference is relevant because quick effects can be activated in between the returns!
		=> Mabye take a different approach and instead of banishing just prevent the effect from equipping a Kanohi with the same name as a removed one in the same turn.
		
		New version of swap effect: Just equip a Kanohi, let the old one destroy itself, and explicitly prevent swapping into ones destroyed this turn.
		=> old ones are automatically excluded since they self-destruct when the new one is equipped
		=> no banishment and related problems
		=> prevents just equipping a Kanohi right back after it was destroyed, that would feel pretty cheap after all
		
		New version of ATK->0 effect: After damage calculation, but also double battle damage
		=> Gives current version of Hau a justification
		=> Allows Ta-Koro to OTK more reliably without needing a bonus battle damage effect on Lhii
		=> Full-on multiplicative might stack a bit too hard, so maybe change that to inflicting damage equal to original ATK if monster is destroyed by battle (a bit like Ghost Mourner) - also fits the "it's on fire and explodes" visual a bit better

		{{Discard to boost ATK}}
		
		Mata Role: Battle
		
		Principle: Courage
		"To be courageous is to place your responsibility and the safety of others above your own safety."
		=> face stronger monsters in battle
		=> shield allies (force opponent to attack a specific monster, e.g. "Your opponent cannot target FIRE monsters you control for attacks, except the FIRE monster with the highest ATK you control"?) 
		=> better: protect from effects while controlling multiple FIRE, so opponent is forced into battle
		
		Courage grants Strength 
		=> ATK manipulation
		
		The enemy of Courage is Fear
		=> Fear prevents battles from taking place by making monsters "flee"
		
		Battle focus has good synergy with Hau's battle protection.
		Huna forces attacks towards stronger targets, might be redundant with the possible "shield allies" effect listed above.
		
		ATK boost could also be before damage calculation, so you can chain block with this and Tahu, and the opponent gets a chance to add additional boosts afterwards (more courageous that way).
		
		Downgrade effect protection to only prevent destruction - covers basically all cases that occured during testing and is closer to appropriate for generic attribute-wide protection.Also, only count and protect face-ups.

	notes:
		{{Let a monster attack twice}}
		
		Block effects on attack 
		=> unexpectedly moving too fast to respond, opponent literally gets Kapura'd
		=> combos well with ATK  boosting and battle focus of Ta-Koro
		
		
		Interesting concept: stackable activations delayed to End Phase (Inflict damage on SS/draw when leave field) => can it somehow be included? Would be nice as a lore adaptation. Original wording:
		"When this card is Special Summoned: Inflict damage equal to its current ATK to your opponent during the End Phase of this turn. When this card leaves the field: Draw 1 card during the End Phase of this turn."
		
		Maybe:
		During the End Phase: Your opponent takes 200 damage for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Or:
		During the End Phase: Draw 1 card for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Both could also activate from GY, only count some subset of FIRE monsters, count field leaves instead of summons, ...
		
		Completely different approach:
		=> Blocking activations is granted to all C.C. Matoran, either from field or GY (for a limited time in the latter case)
		=> "Going fast by moving slowly" is implemented as giving a second attack to a monster that did not attack in your previous turn (or something like that)
		=> or just a monster that was summoned in a previous turn
		=> More attacks helps Ta-Koro a lot
		==> Maybe just attacks on monsters? Possibly too powerful for the sole requirement of having any monster survive for a turn

	notes:
		{{Add Tahu to hand}}
		
		Already has overhaul effects (or lack thereof).
		
		Bonus: Search Tahu when going to GY
		=> no need for search from Tahu's side, since he can just equip the Hau from the GY once you bring him out
		=> Synergy with Copper Kanohi, QftM, Isolde, ...
		=> Can set as bait and plus if opponent takes it
		=> v1.2: Added minor cost and made optional, so you can't get an arbitrary number of free searches off Isolde; banishing monster should barely ever be a problem
		
		Possible mechanical issue: Technically Toa Mata's swap effect can never have any targets at activation while they have Kanohi equipped because that conflicts with the "only one" equip limit.
		=> Simplest solution: Equip Limit is just "Equip only to a Level 6 or higher monster", but there's a second continuous effect stating "If a "Kanohi" Equip Spell Card is equipped to the equipped monster, destroy this card".
		=> Bonus side effect: You can swap with a Kanohi from hand during your turn without banishing the original one.
		=> Self-destruct effect had to be made a trigger effect because YGOPro doesn't like continuous with EVENT_EQUIP :( Big difference: Now the Kanohi won't blow up until the end of the chain, and its attempt to blow up can also be chained to!
		==> oh wait, that was just because trigger effects have implicit effect relation and continuous do not - fixed now
		
		Battle protection feels super pointless on a Ta-Koro board ...
		=> maybe "unaffected by effects that do not target it"? (completes the protection, but doesn't make much sense because Hau is weak to surprise attacks and non-targeting matches those better because you don't get advance warning which monster will be hit)
		
		Alternate approach to mental focus restriction: Allow equipping to any monster, but only give effects when equipped to an appropriate monster.
		=> e.g. "If the equipped monster is a "Toa" or "Makuta" monster, it cannot be destroyed by battle, also you take no battle damage from battles involving that monster."
		=> makes it feasible to use Kanohi in hand for searches
		=> leaves more room for stricter archetype restrictions, which in turn means I have more freedom with the effects
		=> perhaps provides a good hook for any non-regular Kanohi users (Axonn, Brutaka) to just have an effect that states a Kanohi equipped to them gains its effects anyway => longer variant that might be even better for that (since it explicitly states the effect is gained): "While this card is equipped to a "Toa" or "Makuta" monster, it gains this effect.
		* The equipped monster cannot be destroyed by battle, also you take no battle damage from battles involving that monster"

	notes:
		{{Banish and discard to make unaffected}}
		{{Add WATER monster to hand}}
		
		Dislike of compromise: Potentially fix Purity of GY, make monsters unaffected no matter what (without compromise).
		
		Arrow on upper end because Turaga could be designed to have their arrow placements align with the Toa Kaita (Vakama/Whenua/Onewa down, Nokama/Nuju/Matau up, or the other way around). But this actually doesn't make that much sense because Turaga have no Kaita following the same division.
		For Nokama in particular, up arrow allows the protection to apply to either your own monster in the EMZ and your opponent's monster (for disruption in case it needs to be affected by something), but that doesn't quite seem worth giving up the linked zone.
		=> solved by Link 2!
		
		Probably better to send from Deck, otherwise you have the extra condition of needing to keep something in hand if you want protection.
		
		If that's not enough, maybe some other effect that lets you plus to make up for Link 2 summoning?
		=> When this card is Link Summoned: You can target 1 WATER monster in your GY; add that target to your hand.
		=> Possibly with some restriction
		=> Provides discard fodder (potentially even the really good kind since it's WATER monsters) for next turn
		
		Could serve as replacement for Isolde if you can e.g. send any card matching the type of the banished card from deck to gy, but that's probably a bit broken.
		
		Potentially needed buffs:
		=> Recycle on each SS, not just Link?
		==> Recycle when monster summoned to linked zone, that way it's reusable
		==> Discourages opponent from summoning to linked zone on their side, so they can't benefit from protection (though you also lose the rare chance for big brain disruption)
		==> Updated: Trigger is pointing to a monster during opponent's End Phase, so it isn't just a better WATER version of Sunlight Wolf
		===> Matches the idea of protecting your own monster in the linked zone, and still derives benefit from opponent foolishly putting one of their monsters there
		===> Explicitly triggering during opponent's turn fits with Ga-Koro
		=> Send WATER from Deck instead of discard (only if precedent!)
		==> There is none, at least not as a quick effect
		==> But reusable recycle effect means previous discards can come back
		=> Maybe Switch top arrow to middle for synergy with Marincess CA (points at EMZ when revived in simplest case) - also sort of aligns with body/head angle in image
		
		Problem: Not having an exception for the own effect is convenient for disruption, but means Nokama is no longer battle protected while unaffected.
		=> Maybe "unaffected by the effects of cards [...], except "Turaga Nokama""?
		==> Also avoids misinterpretations whereby the effect blocks itself because the monster is only affected by it if it isn't
		==> Maybe "except this card's" is better?
		=> For comfort: Make recycling effect mandatory, so you don't misclick it away - want  to activate it pretty much always anyway, and in the cases where not the other effect makes it easy to get the card in question to GY/banished again

		{{Normal Summon by Tributing from hand}}
		{{Negate effect and gain ATK}}
		{{Equip Kanohi from hand or GY}}
		
		Problem with main eff: "When" misses timing too often, "if" instantly recycles materials & handtraps; Recycling of handtraps may not be safe either way
		
		Alt.: If a monster(s) is banished: You can target 1 of your banished monsters; add it to your hand.
		=> Or target in GY anyway?
		=> Might be hard to trigger reliably, especially in Toa_Mata.dek
		
		Latest version: Not broken and still plenty activatable, but still has problems.
		=> Not triggerable through destruction by battle because no precedent for triggering off both battle destruction and any (including non-destruction) sending to GY by effect
		=> Not triggerable by costs, so WATER synergy is limited, but otherwise you'd be in the convenient handtrap recycling scenario again
		
		Another possibility: Once per turn, if a monster(s) is sent to the GY: You can target 1 Level 4 or lower monster in your GY with a different name than that monster(s); add it to your hand.
		=> No handtrap recycling, but wordy
		=> Also triggers off summon materials, which is not desirable - maybe an "except for a summon" clause is possible?
		=> Or maybe just "sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but then activation requirement becomes non-universal again
		=> maybe "destroyed by battle, or sent from the hand or Deck to the GY"? - but that's a bit uncohesive
		=> precedent for that last one exists on Resort Staff and Firewall Dragon, so I guess we'll take it
		
		Maybe add a discard cost to the effect so it becomes neutral
		=> Would allow triggering Atlanteans etc
		
		Completely new effect:
		=> Trigger on own effect activations so it's more or less a quick effect in both Ga-Koro and Toa Mata decks
		=> Negate effects as disruption (Onua needs something else then), basically disabling targets by putting them underwater - also the most "peaceful" form of offense
		=> Can also negate effects on own field to perhaps stop something negative = mediator role in the team
		=> Negate on every Kanohi switch by a different Toa may be too OP since there's no upper limit once you have 2+ Kanohi - maybe require it to be an effect that targets your own cards? On the other hand, Gali herself does have OPT.
		
		Possible buffs:
		=> Gain LP equal to target's ATK to represent the healing stuff - may muscle in on Onu territory though
		=> Make negate permanent like Onua's originally was
		==> Definitely seems worth considering
		=> Gain ATK after negate (either small boost permanently or large boost temporarily)
		==> Preferred: Permanently
		==> Helps getting over big dudes with protection
		==> TODO: Lore association
		===> Patience + "some situations can only be resolved with overwhelming offensive force"
		=> Might be a problem that the effect becomes impossible to activate unless your monster effect is last in the chain
		==> See how it works in Toa Mata decks first, where Kanohi-switching can always be chained to serve as the trigger
		==> Kanohi-switching has been moved to the Suva, so the trigger should probably be made more accessible
		===> Slightly more involved idea: "Once per turn, if the turn player's opponent activates a monster effect: ..."
		====> "Turn player's opponent" (c) Octobypass
		====> Works as it used to on the opponent's turn, so Ga-Koro can make the fullest use of it
		====> But also serves as an anti-disruption tool on your turn
		====> This wording would make it easy to expand the scope of triggering effects to cover all cards (monster effect -> card or effect), but not sure if that's a good idea
		====> Still breaks when stuff is chained to an applicable effect, but searching backwards in the chain looks so contrived...

		{{Reveal top card of both Decks and Special Summon}}
		{{Draw 1 card}}
		
		Idea: Make Turaga Link 2 because using a lone Absolute Zero as material for Nokama/Nuju is kinda degenerate, and just attribute+type is a weaker requirement than most other Link 1 monsters. Sneak advantage: Monsters with inappropriate attributes can be linked away as a Turaga's second material.
		
		Need 4 arrows to have 6 distinct combinations of 2 among them - not sure which 4, but these two make the most sense for Vakama at least because it lets him co-link with Knightmare Phoenix.
		
		This way the summon is a -1, so the effect should do more than generate slight virtual advantage.
		
		Draw when FIRE Warrior destroyed by battle: Combos with self (run over opponent's Token to draw), Ta-Koro (forces opponent into battle if you have 2 or more FIRE monsters), and Huna (forces opponent to attack other monsters, likely FIRE Warriors). Possibly redundant with Kapura's current GY effect.
		=> Draw 2 because destroying by battle is a difficult condition and you need to make up for the discard from the Ta-Koro combo
		=> Maybe even "If a monster is destroyed in a battle involving a FIRE Warrior monster"?
		=> Draw 2 could be abused generically by crashing the Tokens into each other, so maybe stick with 1 for now and see how that works without Kapura's draws.
		
		Effect gets kinda long now :(

		2 monsters, including a FIRE Warrior monster
		You can activate this effect; each player reveals the top card of their Deck, and if it is a FIRE Warrior monster, they Special Summon it. Otherwise, they Special Summon 1 "Vision Token" (Warrior/FIRE/Level 3/ATK 1500/DEF 0) in Attack Position, but it cannot be Tributed or used as material for a Synchro or Link Summon. When a monster is destroyed by battle: Draw 1 card. You can only use each effect of "Turaga Vakama" once per turn.

		Originally effect negation, but when should that trigger and how does it fit into Onu-Koro.dek?
		
		Effect: Add monster from GY
		=> Adds resources to fill the resource generation role
		=> Potential to set up Toa Mata summons
		=> Goes well with Tahu for Akamai.dek
		=> Pakari increases ATK, therefore damage, therefore range of monsters that can be added
		=> May clash with Onu-Koro removing monsters from GY
		
		Alternate effect: Once per turn, if/when a card(s)/monster(s) is sent to the GY (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 card in either GY; if that target is a monster with less ATK than this card, gain LP equal to half its ATK, also place it on the top or the bottom of the Deck."
		=> Complies with Onu-Koro strategy of recycling resources, and complements it by also being able to get S/T back into the Deck
		=> Can potentially serve as GY disruption on the opponent's turn, meaning Onua reinforces to the Onu deck's somewhat lacking ability to put up interaction turn 1
		=> Symbolism is basically the same as the other effect (i.e., just Drill Warrior)
		=> Activation condition is more easily fullfilled outside BP

		Effect: Kick S/T to pieces, also gets a bonus if there's a Rock around as a sneaky reference to the rock kicking function - triggered by ED summon for Po-Koro synergy
		=> The S/T reduction by itself could actually work without even the soft OPT restriction, the bonus burn on the other hand kind of warrants a hard one
		=> Maybe instead of burn, make it so having a Rock prevents activation of the targeted card (because it's destroyed by kicking a rock at it from a distance and therefore the opponent is caught by surprise), then it could be unlimited
		=> Could also be triggered by Tribute Summons (in addition to ED summons), since it's also a form of the Po-Koro idea of "creating" something bigger out of materials and would have synergy with Toa Mata in general - whether that's justifiable or not depends on how Po-Koro turns out

		=> May not be necessary if you're running multiple anyway, but test
		=> Not really much synergy with Ga-Koro...
		v2: Sneak out "repeatedly" on opponent's turn, so it gets Ga-Koro's speed boost and fulfills Nokama's battle protection condition after being used to summon her.
		=> Maybe even banish a card from GY as cost so you get rid of Isolde?
		v3: Trigger on activation of opponent's card and summon to same column.
		=> Sneak out when something interesting happens, to where that is happening
		=> qualifies for updated Ga-Koro speed boost because CL2+
		=> Makes text hella long
		
		Buffs:

		==> sneaking out to see Huki on the "other" team (Po-Koro), getting comfy with him so combat-readiness drops
		==> Maybe even give Huki an ATK boost effect to interact with this

		{{Special Summon WATER monster from hand}}
		{{Affected by "Ga-Koro, Village of Water": Cannot Special Summon from Extra Deck, except WATER monsters}}
		
		
		Mata Role: Disruption
		
		Completely different approach to the same idea: Propagate purity from one location to others (=> ripples!), SS from hand/GY for Speed while also automatically providing a WATER Warrior (or any other type). Also adjust Level to enable Bahamut, Toad plays.
		
		Wording for part after "then" of latest version really needs work.
		
		Or, a more balanced version of the old approach:
		During your opponent's turn, if all monsters in your GY are WATER, your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects.
		=> Fixes the weakness to responses in Nokama's and Maku's effects.
		=> Literally grants +2 Spell Speed (from Quick Effect to unrespondable)
		=> Maybe during your turn it does the hand=WATER thing instead?
		=> Might not even need the secondary SS effect this way, since Speed is already covered
		Surprisingly concise version of that, including a bit of a restriction so Crystrons can't quite do all their stuff with it up:
		"You cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except WATER monsters. If all monsters in your GY (min. 1) are WATER, apply this effect, depending on whose turn it is.
		*Your turn: All monsters in your hand become WATER.
		*Opponent's turn: Your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the activation of your WATER monster's effects."
		
		Effect to summon from hand added again because there tend to be some cards left in hand you can't get out otherwise.
		
		Potential problem: Crystron Synergy!
		=> maybe there's some way to have the added spell speed only for "defensive" effects?
		=> added "as Chain Link 2 or higher" clause which fixes that problem, but potentially limits usefulness in other ways
		
		Adjusting Level on 2nd eff would be really good for Toad purposes.
		
		Ideas for Poison as enemy of purity:
		=> Change attribute of monsters in GY
		=> Continuously negate effects/prevent their activation (so even Spell Speed 4 is useless)
		
		General potentially needed buffs for Ga Decks:
		=> resistance to battle
		==> Maybe "your opponent cannot target WATER monsters you control for attacks, except the WATER monster with the highest ATK you control" on something
		==> or make Nokama untargetable/indestructible by battle while pointing to a monster
		==> or make Gali suppress battle in addition to effects
		
		Potentialy buffs:
		=> Give CL2 speed boost during own turn as well - rather not, because right now we have a certain level of focus on the opponent's turn
		
		Note: ED restriction can be circumvented if you have two - just set one to replace the face-up one
		=> Maybe make that a lingering effect when activating the summon or the card?

card:

	notes:
		Tuner because Hal synergy
		
		Maybe some effect to get more S/T in the GY so Nokama can immunize more against monsters - sort of feels right for the Astrologer profession as well. Example:
		"If a WATER monster is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: You can send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck, then draw 1 card."
		=> Can trigger during either player's turn so you can chain to it for Ga-Koro immunity
		=> (Probably) triggers if used as material for Nokama, so that's convenient
		=> Dumps S/T as cost, so even if you negate it you get the fodder (probably bad design since it's a pseudo-cost, should be altered)
		=> Draw 1 to keep up fodder for Nokama, place self on bottom of Deck to limit reuse
		=> Maybe the bottom of deck + draw 1 business can be tied into Astrology as well
		
		New and mechanically improved:
		"If a WATER monster(s) is Special Summoned while this card is in your GY: If there are no Spells/Traps in your GY, send 1 Spell/Trap from your Deck to your GY, otherwise send the top card of your Deck to the GY; place this card on the bottom of the Deck."
		=> Now only does targeted dumping in the specific situation where you don't have any S/T as Nokama fodder
		=> Otherwise sends random card, which may be good or not - top card matches Vakama's "vision" theme so that might fit with astrology
		=> Dumping is still cost so if you get the random card and it's an Atlantean you can get the effect
		=> Exact relation to astrology still TODO
		
		Other considerations:
		=> A way to SS easily may be useful if it's to replace Arboria
		=> Noodle may be banned at some point, so don't rely too hard on the summon from deck
		=> To reach more Synchro levels with Lv2 Matoran, level manipulation might be an idea - would also fit with astrology because "stars"
		=> Don't do ALL of the above because that would be way too many effects!

		{{Normal Summon (Kini-Nui)}}
		{{Special Summon tributed "Toa" from GY}}
		{{Destroy Kini-Nui to summon a Rock}}
		
		Alternate approach to Kanohi-switching effect, so that doesn't have to repeated on every Toa.
		
		Thematically having it on the Suva makes more sense, so the Kini-Nui can do something else as the designated Toa Mata field spell.
		=> Extra NS for Toa Mata?
		=> Trigger when tributing from hand / tributing a Toa Mata for a Toa Mata?
		=> searching/recycling?
		
		All specific features (Suva Kaita, Golden Kanohi, Amaja Nui, Toa Stones) are already separate cards, so all that's left here is basic utility for Toa Mata with no direct lore correspondence.
		=> Extra NS - we can tribute from hand, so that allows doing a lot more
		=> Recycle on tribute summon - to make up for cards lost in the process
		==> Especially useful when tributing a Toa Mata for a Toa Mata
		==> Recycles Toa in general, so it works on Kaita, Nuva, and theoretically later generations (practically the card has no place in non-Mata decks)
		
		Recycling effect probably needs a bit of a buff
		=>  allow targets outside of Toa so it's basically always live - e.g. "You can target 1 "Toa" monster or 1 monster with the same Attribute as the Summoned monster in your GY; add it to your hand"?
		=> Special summon instead of adding to your hand, probably with discard cost (which could help ditching Kanohi for searches)?
		=> Instead of triggering on Tribute Summon, make it an ignition effect with the condition of controlling a (Tribute Summoned) Toa Mata?
		=> Maybe work specifically with the Tribute rather than a selected monster - "If a monster(s) is Tributed for the Tribute Summon of a "Toa Mata" monster and sent to the GY: You can target 1 of those monsters; if it is a "Toa" monster, Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position, otherwise add it to your hand."
		==> Makes the effect (almost) always live by definition
		==> Distinction between archetypal and other targets justifies Special Summoning instead of just adding
		==> Similar trigger actually already exists on SHS Trumpeter
		==> Bad synergy with Suva, since it needs to be in the GY for the SS effect
		
		Empirical result: Want to run at 3 because it makes it much easier to summon Toa, but multiples are useless
		=> Additional effect that sends self to GY as cost to get something useful would help, since having a second copy would effectively make that free
		=> "You can send this card from the Field Zone to the GY; add 1 Level 1 Rock monster (with 0 ATK/DEF) from your Deck to your hand."
		=> Searches Suva and Suva Kaita, especially the latter is thematically fitting
		=> Provides more consistent Suva access for Kanohi-centric builds
		=> Even searching Level 1 Rocks in general has no crazy broken targets at the moment, Nemeses Keystone is as good as it gets in this category - shouldn't change either since generic searchers for both Level 1s and Rocks exist
		=> Rather than sending as cost, it would also possible to self-destruct in the effect so (current draft version of) Mata Nui gets triggered
		==> Kini-Nui getting destroyed and leaving behind rocks is a sneaky reference to its ultimate fate as well
		=> May be OP that you can use the extra NS and recycle for a combo, then self-destruct to get another card for further combos (while still having your regular NS) all in the same turn, so maybe make the new effect an End Phase trigger
		==> Buffing it to Special Summon instead of add would allow it to set up a Suva during your End Phase to make Kanohi in GY live
		==> Using it during your opponent's End Phase instead gives you an additional Suva/Suva Kaita during your next turn
		==> Having it happen in the End Phase enhances the aforementioned lore connection as well
		
		Observation: The combination of an extra NS and bringing any tribute back to the hand essentially makes Toa Mata a free summon in just about every deck.
		=> not what they're balanced for
		=> Toa Mata deck mostly tributes other Toa or stuff that they want in the GY (e.g. Suva), so no need for that there
		=> Koro decks already got enough value out of Toa Mata to justify using them when they used up the real Normal Summon, so they can definitely live without the recycling option
		=> Therefore: Make recycling effect limited to the SS case, while non-Toa tributes just stay in the GY

		"One was prosperous by attaining great wealth, often through hard work."
		=> wealth = card advantage?
		=> wealth = LP?
		=> hard work = performing summons?
		=> basically, ramp deck that slowly but stably accumulates wealth while drawing the duel out
		
		Prosperity grants Stamina.
		=> helps with executing more hard work
		
		The enemy of Prosperity is Hunger.
		=> saps away whatever resource are needed for hard work
		=> currently would just make opponent gain LP, so not really relevant
		=> unless: hard work is reducing opponent's LP
		
		Pakari's ATK boost seems to fit in more with Ta-Koro's playstyle, though it would be redundant there.
		=> if hard work is reducing opponent's LP, a bigger beatstick would have some synergy
		Ruru currently has no relevance.
		=> maybe inflict damage based on revealed card, like Aqua Dolphin
		
		Improvement for draw effect: Just pay up to 3000 LP to draw up to 3, rather than equalizing with opponent
		=> doesn't become super inefficient when you're far ahead in LP
		=> no need to account for possible difference between LP at activation and resolution in code
		=> may or may not still require higher LP at activation
		=> use case where you can go +2 by being even just 100 LP ahead  may be problematic
		==> "then, if your LP are lower than your opponent's, discard 1 card for every 1000 points difference" might fix that
		==> "then, if your LP are lower than your opponent's, discard the same number of cards you drew" may be more elegant and still seems to work in practice
		==> also, maybe send to GY instead of discard in either case

		{{Pay 1000 LP to add EARTH Warrior to hand}}
		
		LP gain = overseeing the work (work here being the process of using up your monsters)
		=> Potentially better to put this on Onu-Koro and the active LP gain effect from Onu-Koro on Whenua 
		=> Something for the other kind of work (reducing opponent's LP) as well? Would bring immediate synergy with potential burn effect for Ruru...
		Search something new = studying the past to avoid future problems
		=> past = GY
		=> avoiding future problems = getting some monster you haven't tried yet
		=> very likely too generic (only EARTH? only EARTH Warrior?)
		=> shuffling monsters from GY back conflicts with Onu-Koro a bit (might not have enough monsters for both)
		=> More accessible version: On Link Summon, search an EARTH Warrior with a different name than everything in GY (makes up for the summon minus, so Onu-Koro wealth is not impacted)
		==> no shuffling back, because that would be stealing resources Onu-Koro needs
		=> Searching may be too good since it's only slightly more limited in targets than Isolde while lacking the whole "not this turn" restriction
		==> Instead, could send an EARTH Warrior with a different name from monsters in GY to GY, then shuffle back another (EARTH? Warrior?) monster from GY - literally learning from the mistakes of the past (not getting the right monster in GY to begin with) and providing the solution that lets you proceed in the present (by getting what you need into the GY)
		==> Total GY count remains identical, so it does not hinder Onu-Koro and may avoid being useful to Po-Koro (though any deck with GY effects can make use of dumping a specific monster, so probably not)
		==> Really good with Goukis since it lets you activate Rematch even if only 1 material was a Gouki, but does it actually synergize with the not yet existent Onu-Matoran?

		Noble Ruru: Night Vision, but doesn't glow
		=> illuminate a set card

		=> Problem A: Doesn't do anything when opponent doesn't have any set cards, and very little without a set monster
		==> Solution for second part: Base damage in the S/T case
		==> Interacting with hand would not match usual light semantics and be possibly too powerful for a Noble Kanohi, so the case without any Set cards remains a weakness
		=> Problem B: Even with a set monster, damage is minuscule
		==> Damage equal to the difference may yield better results
		=> Hard OPT to avoid degenerate burn loops (since the same Set card could theoretically be revealed over and over again)
		==> The bullet points needed for this are actually the main reason the new mental focus restriction isn't worded as an explicitly gained effect, because we can't exactly nest bullet points and inconsistency would suck

		Another alternative way to not have the requip effect on every single Toa.
		
		Hole in strategy: How to get on field after tributing?
		
		Variant A:
		You can reveal this card and 1 "Toa Mata" monster in your hand; this card's attribute becomes that other monster's attribute, until the end of this turn. Once per Chain (Quick Effect): You can target 1 face-up "Toa Mata" monster you control; equip 1 "Kanohi" Equip Spell Card from your hand or GY to that target, except a card that is in the GY because it was destroyed while face-up on the field and sent there this turn.
		
		Variant B:
		Pictured
		=> supports all Toa rather than just Mata because Kanohi-switching could always be relevant, and even with the Mata you want it to work on the Kaita as well
		=> multi-attribute effect only goes in effect on field, so without a field spell you can't efficiently tribute this for a Toa Mata, which limits consistency
		==> permanent multi-attribute? - no precedent for a Level 1 with that, possibly too much secondary utilty
		===> should be fine if it's just in hand
		==> on-demand attribute change in hand and on field? - should work, but wordy
		=> non-OPT SS procedure means this would be an instant OTK with cards like Cannon Soldier, so maybe avoid that
		==> hard to get rid of if you have a Toa anyway, so summoning once per turn should be enough
		=> a card with more than 3 effects already feels like a bit of a clusterfuck, so an attempt was made to cut this down to the most important 3 by cutting the protection
		==> Problem A: No protection, so you can easily lose your Suva, but your opponent also has to expend resources to achieve this and you can get it back during your turn if you have a Toa - experiment to see if this is sufficient
		==> Problem B: No attribute adjustment on field, so it could interfere with Koro strategies - maybe make it so it takes the attribute of the targeted Toa when Kanohi swapping (but then you might be forced into an unnecessary swap just so your Koro isn't dead) or on summon
		===> or just make the continuous adjustment work on field if you have a Koro - looks a bit weird in text, but perfectly and exactly solves the issue
		
		The general idea is that a Suva in Defense Position should act like a continouous Spell/Trap that can also be destroyed by battle (the only real reason it's a monster is so you can tribute it for the Toa). This works without any special protection, except in the presence of piercing or battle position changing effects, where the card is instead a huge liability.
		=> adding a small protection effect to negate battle damage would fix this

		Piercing damage got added to the Pakari, so we need something else here. Suggestion: Hand reveal.
		=> Existing cards commonly associate light with revealing set cards, while hand reveals are associated with mind reading and straight up cheating
		=> X-Ray Vision "looking through" cards in hand is a straightforward imaginary cheating situation, so we can arguably apply that mechanic here
		=> Making unaffected is a bonus to achieve a suitable powerlevel for a Great Kanohi and fits in with Kaukau/Miru for the Rua
		==> Currently redundant with Kaukau and Miru because together they already make the monster fully unaffected, but if that changes to something like destruction and targeting protection this could be handy to deal with any remaining outs.

		Considerations for overhaul of Toa Mata combinations:
		=> help with qualities like consistency and recoverability, since main deck Toa Mata don't explicitly interact
		=> ideally, abilities of the participants should have visible influence in the combination's effect
		=> maybe also try to trigger the corresponding Toa Mata effects (e.g. Magma triggers Onua by sending a Toa to GY and has high ATK so it might trigger Tahu by battle)
		=> Idea to encourage using the matching attributes of Toa Mata: "During the Standby Phase: You can tribute this card, then target 2 Level 6 "Toa Mata" monsters in your GY (1 FIRE monster and 1 EARTH monster); Special Summon those targets."
		==> Or during End Phase, or as a floating effect on destroy/banish by opponent's card (would be a bit of a nerf)
		==> Maybe put some restriction on those monsters like not being able to use them for an Xyz Summon until the end of X turn
		==> Lets you use the Combination effect and then make the triggers of the Toa Mata used as material live again, but only if you used the right attributes (or already had them i

		=> Upgrade Kanohi searches to straight up SS
		=> target and reveal both in cost to avoid ambiguous situations where you activate this card targeting some Kanohi, but only get the appropriate monster into hand between activation and resolution - look up how that works (probably shouldn't be legal to activate in that case)
		=> Maybe even equip Kanohi from GY (but in that case with stricter cost/condition)
		
		First effect: replicates NS equip effect of original Toa Mata, probably a more reliable way of searching than requiring battle destruction.

		Second effect could also be something that gives a reward (e.g. a draw) for completing the "quest" by having a certain number of Kanohi in the GY.

Monsters Special Summoned by this effect cannot attack during the turn they are Summoned. If this face-down card is destroyed by your opponent's card effect and sent to the Graveyard: You can destroy all monsters you control (min. 1); Special Summon 1 "Toa" monster from your hand or Deck. You can only activate 1 "Coming of the Toa" effect per turn, and only once that turn
		
		Keep the on-destruction effect or can we live without that crutch now?
		=> Could search Quest for the Masks as a secondary effect (e.g. during End Phase after getting sent to the GY, whether activated or removed), so we get a little Call->Coming->Quest chain going
		=> Another approach would be to have the return to hand and the Quest search happen simultaneously, so you get it as a reward for actually having the Toa stay on the field that long and also have some summons to trigger Quest set up right away
		
		Generic Toa support or only Toa Mata?
		=> SS restriction needs to be generic because of Toa Kaita
		=> Might actually be too good to have exceptions from the restriction, can be an instant Kaita on your turn just from having this card set and a few random monsters in the GY
		
		Temporary outcome up to +3 Toa on field, permanent outcome up to +3 Toa in hand
		=>With Toa Mata, can set up appropriate triggers at the appropriate time
		=> multiple Toa Mata in hand automatically means  at least one is summonable
		=> too much plus or is it fine because it's a conditional trap?

		If other cards are sufficient to summon multiple Toa, maybe make this aid Kaita with something like letting a Toa Mata be treated as 2 materials?
		<soft-line>
		GY eff: Also replace with something relevant to Kaita?
		
		Latest idea after testing Toa Mata deck with Suva and Kini-Nui: Recovery tool to bring back Toa from GY/banished.
		=> tribute to SS from GY - no strong restrictions, targets readily available, requires summoning Suva Kaita first and only replaces it with a Toa
		=> banish from GY to SS banished -  locks SS for the rest of the turn, targets need to set up with e.g. Kanohi, can be used whenever Suva Kaita is in GY (including right after using the first effect)
		=> Both effects being usable in one turn is intentional, to offer the ability to go from just one Suva Kaita to a rank 6 provided GY and banished are set up properly - important for comebacks, may of course be overkill
		=> SS restriction affecting only the Extra Deck and working for the whole turn (not just the rest) would also make sense, since that way it still doesn't prevent summoning Suva Kaita itself
		=> May want it to only work on "Toa Mata" or Level 6 or lower "Toa" - reviving Nuva that easily probably isn't a good idea
		=> Maybe also negate the effects of the summoned monsters, destroy/banish them at the end of the turn, ... to make it clear that making a Rank 6 (Kaita) is the main goal
		=> Maybe add an activation condition (control no other monsters, control no "Toa" monsters (like in the old version)) to first effect</soft-line>

		Spell version because having a trap as a consistency booster probably wouldn't work very well for the deck
		
		Since it excavates (because the Toa being called are still in the future), the logic here is that a higher number of hits implies more Toa still in the Deck and therefore less in hand/GY. So:
		=> 0 gives you a Suva/Suva Kaita to do something with the Toa you presumably already have
		==> could theoretically be abused as a generic searcher in an (not yet existing) archetype with appropriate targets, though it would still be a -1
		=> 3 gives you a Coming (maybe even "can be activated during this turn"?) so you can quickly fetch all those Toa in your Deck
		=> 1 / 2 do something inbetween, but what?
		=> Check if it's still a good idea to have the >0 effects cumulative once the new ones are all done
		=> Also do some math on probabilities of getting each effect to figure out how to balance them
		
		Alternative effects (with broader grouping):
		* 0: Add 1 Level 1 Rock monster with 0 ATK/DEF from your Deck to your hand.
		* 1+: Add 1 of those monsters to your hand.
		* 3+: Special Summon 1 of those monsters.
