		Ending the turn after SS from Deck is too punishing, but since this effect is a +1 we do need to have fairly strict restrictions
		=> definitely lock down summoned monster to not attack or use its effects that turn, summon material should be ok since that's one of the main reasons to use this
		=> extend HOPT to summon effect?
		=> only work when Normal Summoned/Set, so you can't turn 5 Krana you got by some way into 5 Bohrok?

		(This card is not treated as a "Toa" card.)
		If all monsters you control are Normal Summoned "Toa" monsters (min. 1), you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 "Toa" monster you control; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it. A monster equipped with this card gains 2000 ATK, also its effects are negated and its name becomes "Exo-Toa". If the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect, destroy this card instead. During the End Phase, if this card is in the GY because it was sent there this turn: Set 1 "Exo Armaments" directly from your Deck. You can only use this effect of "Exo-Toa" once per turn.

		{{Special Summon 1 of those monsters}}

		Helps Ga-Koro against the Bohrok, but also works in underwater Rahi dot dek
		=> very powerful recycling effect for banish costs, but does destroy itself and doesn't come back if banished as a tradeoff (also won't work with non-WATER Rahi!)
		=> can SS from hand if you feed it Fish, possibly triggering one of your other scales
		=> help against the Bohrok is summarized in one handy effect to destroy face-downs (and stuff changed to defense by Shore Turtle) when attacked by anything smol, like a Matoran or a lil Rahi fish
		==> banish self so we don't *gasp* powercreep Drillroid
		=> Lack of explicit references to Rahi is a little odd ...
		==> there we go, now the self-banish is a Rahi-banish
		=> might still want some way to get this from banished?
		==> maybe instead of SS from hand, use the Fish/Sea Serpent/Aqua banish as the drawback there?
		==> banish from hand/field/GY so it isn't strictly worse than Ghekula

		Bit of an odd FIRE synergy, to maybe set up the Firebird theme for way later
		=> Pendulum Effect is thematically so neat I don't want to change it, but it doesn't do much ...
		==> you know what, let's lean further into the fire theming and just make it bonus burn if they touch our monsters (no actual FIRE required)
		==> wanted to make it continuous 200 for each attack or targeting effect, but we don't have any precedent for continuous post-battle damage ...
		=> GY effect is designed to go with Hikaki detach (also FIRE) - before it self-destructs, you get to pop an opponent's card!
		=> Banish effect opened up to also get other Rahi if needed

		Similar ideas of protection and shepherding as before, but shuffled around a bit
		=> self-SS is in Pendulum Effect like on other Beasts, and relatively inexpensive too
		==> too inexpensive it feels like, so let's rephrase that in a way that doesn't put more on the field, but is at the same time more flexible
		=> protection is a monster effect so it can work more or less anywhere
		=> returning something to the "herd" on banish is too perfect to leave, but it's now Type-locked and gets conveniently triggered by the protection
		==> actually without the Type lock this is super neat in Rahi Nui, so let's put that restriction on the protection instead
