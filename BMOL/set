		Originally:
		Cannot be destroyed by battle or targeted by your opponent's card effects. During each of your Standby Phases: Increase this face-up Attack Position card's level by 1. If this card is attacked by an opponent's monster, return that monster to the bottom of the deck at the end of the Damage Step.
		
		Updated with some additional effects to facilitate more proactive play, but might be too cluttered so a few of those should go on support cards
		=> in light of recent developments, we probably can't avoid designing these around Yubel and related Fiend engines ...

		{{Special Summon this card}}
		{{Add 1 "Kraata" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand?}}
		{{Affected by "Erosive Kraata Ul": Cannot Special Summon, except DARK Fiend monsters}}
		
		Kraata concept: Little 0/0s that spam themselves onto the field in Attack Position with a DARK Fiend lock (so as to also allow Makuta and Rahkshi), are indestructible by battle, and use their powers when battling an opponent's monster small enough for the Kraata's current Level
		=> Level gain comes from various cards in the archetype
		=> Extra Deck route with Rahkshi who can more freely wield the powers
		=> key points: which powers combine with which roles in the swarming combo, where do the locks come in?
		==> current concept is making the ones that act as removal in battle (Fear, Shattering) NS/SS starters, the ones with other offensive effects (Hunger, Poison) extenders that SS if you control a Kraata, and the support ones (Disintegration, Anger) hybrids that apply the DARK Fiend lock
		==> this conveniently gives us one of each per group that appears in the movie!
		=> yes, the battle part does overlap with Yubel a bit, we'll see if there's synergy
		=> what should the Level-to-ATK ratio be?
		==> initially tried 800, as a standard value that gets used for a lot of things
		==> exceeds practical ATK thresholds quite quickly, so maybe 600 instead?
		===> good old 6 is also pretty standard in this project after all
		===> Stage 5 is where some powers start affecting the Nuva, so 3000 there fits
		===> also means the MoL Rahkhsi being made from Stage 5 or 6 aligns with them appearing to physically overpower the Toa Nuva
		
		Disintegration: Passively reduce opponent stats so your effects work at lower Levels
		=> combo role is hybrid that gets you a Spell/Trap, though with the current design of the Field Spell at least that isn't quite enough to be a one card starter ...
		
		Some practical considerations:
		=> condition for SS should allow for non-Kraata since you want a bit of splashability with the Field Spell search, and don't want to be screwed by the existence of Rahkshi and Makuta
		==> therefore, make it a DARK Fiend limitation, to align with the lock
		=> also the lock should not prevent Energized Protodermis Destiny from working once we get the Rahkshi Armor, so we're being a bit unusual and only restriciting Effect Monsters (so the Token is still fine!)
		=> forcing SS in Attack Position is kind of a waste of words, since Yubel can already do the invincible blocker thing way better, there's plenty of outside ways to SS these in Defense, and the fact that we want to attack for proactive removal means there's incentive to put them in Attack as well
		==> then again, that last point doesn't apply to the passive ones, so maybe they alone should be Attack Position only after all?

		If this was a Kraata, it would make extending combos a lot easier
		=> not even unreasonable since it's just an evolved Kraata at this stage
		=> however, the summoning shortcut and materials become kinda recursive at that point unless we waste more words to avoid that
		=> or just make the Field Spell work with DARK Fiends generically, there we go
		==> not quite, would also need certain SS requirements to tolerate it

card:
	has styling: false
	notes:
		There are a lot of possible material clauses for these - canonically, it's 1 Kraata evolved into armor and 1 other Kraata of the same Type
		=> 2x Kraata Za is too restrictive
		=> Kraata Za + Rahkshi Armor hard requires access to Armor
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Kraata is convenient, but clearly missing a step; also you wouldn't be able to use Rahkshi Armor if that's a card with e.g. a Fusion effect
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Rahkshi lets us use the Armor and also repurpose other Rahkshi, but falsely suggests you can swap the Kraata between different armors
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Level 4 or higher Fiend has some enticing benefits
		==> can use Rahkshi Armor by making it a L4+ Fiend
		==> can use another Kraata if it's been boosted enough
		===> if it's the same Type as the power-granting one, its Level counts towards the ATK, so you get a reward for doing it correctly!
		==> can use some generic stuff maybe (anything broken?)

		Avohkii concept:
		=> highly consistent engine, Jaller/Takua/Sealed Avohkii are all roughly equivalent starters that can sometimes also extend
		=> initial payoff is Jaller, Takua, and an extra search
		=> then the Extra Deck (Rahi mounts) let you get more value out of that while always looping back to Jaller + Takua
		=> general gimmick of revealing the Avohkii to do stuff
		
		Jaller is the general searcher for everything EXCEPT Equip Spells - he's in charge of the quest, but not the one who finds the actual mask
		=> simple SS from hand by revealing Avohkii (but only in Defense because he's fairly big)

		Principles: Single-use Spell/Traps resembling the principle-based Koro effects

		=> GY effecs represent the matching Kolhii skill and work with the entire Matoran evolution line
		=> arguably makes more sense to swap the target pools since you don't see a lot of Turaga playing Kolhii and the Principles apply to the entire Matoran society, but not sure how well that would work for splashability
		==> should be fine since either way at least works with Hahli, and in general the principle effects are things that are good to use with the archetypal lower-tier monsters rather than any generic Extra Deck bosses they might be making
		==> However, a double attack for any WATER or Warrior is maybe too quickly game-ending, will have to watch out for that
		
		Principle of Purity: Prevent outside intereference in your plays
		=> targeted negate of monster effect that also hits one of your own, but if it's a Quick Effect you can chain it so Ga-Matoran have an advantage
		==> unless, of course, the thing you're negating was a response to your Ga-Matoran effect, so this might be a bit of a wonky approach to the intended use case
		==> generally negating responses risks being a bit toxic in a turn 1 combo, and conflicts with Ga-Koro not allowing those responses in the first place
		==> would make sense to be able to target any opponent's card, but then it's kinda just Drillbeam ...
		===> eh, distinct enough since we do have to target our own monster too
		=> destruction after negation is tied to a variant of Ga-Koro's GY purity condition, so we have that interpretation included as well

		THE LINK-2 THAT SEARCHES THE CONTINUOUS SPELL THAT SEARCHES THE FIELD SPELL
		=> needs Attribute-changing so Kolhii Field works properly (also you get to pick which village the champions are from)
		==> continuous phrasing needs to handle multi-Attribute stuff, could also just target a Warrior on summon and copy it
		=> direct attack is based on Kolhii gameplay (see also: Huki)
