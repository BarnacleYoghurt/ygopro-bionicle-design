		Originally:
		Cannot be destroyed by battle or targeted by your opponent's card effects. During each of your Standby Phases: Increase this face-up Attack Position card's level by 1. If this card is attacked by an opponent's monster, return that monster to the bottom of the deck at the end of the Damage Step.
		
		Updated with some additional effects to facilitate more proactive play, but might be too cluttered so a few of those should go on support cards
		=> in light of recent developments, we probably can't avoid designing these around Yubel and related Fiend engines ...

		{{Special Summon this card}}
		{{Add 1 "Kraata" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand?}}
		{{Affected by "Erosive Kraata Ul": Cannot Special Summon, except DARK Fiend monsters}}
		
		Kraata concept: Little 0/0s that spam themselves onto the field in Attack Position with a DARK Fiend lock (so as to also allow Makuta and Rahkshi), are indestructible by battle, and use their powers when battling an opponent's monster small enough for the Kraata's current Level
		=> Level gain comes from various cards in the archetype
		=> Extra Deck route with Rahkshi who can more freely wield the powers
		=> key points: which powers combine with which roles in the swarming combo, where do the locks come in?
		==> current concept is making the ones that act as removal in battle (Fear, Shattering) NS/SS starters, the ones with other offensive effects (Hunger, Poison) extenders that SS if you control a Kraata, and the support ones (Disintegration, Anger) hybrids that apply the DARK Fiend lock
		==> this conveniently gives us one of each per group that appears in the movie!
		=> yes, the battle part does overlap with Yubel a bit, we'll see if there's synergy
		=> what should the Level-to-ATK ratio be?
		==> initially tried 800, as a standard value that gets used for a lot of things
		==> exceeds practical ATK thresholds quite quickly, so maybe 600 instead?
		===> good old 6 is also pretty standard in this project after all
		===> Stage 5 is where some powers start affecting the Nuva, so 3000 there fits
		===> also means the MoL Rahkhsi being made from Stage 5 or 6 aligns with them appearing to physically overpower the Toa Nuva
		
		Disintegration: Passively reduce opponent stats so your effects work at lower Levels
		=> combo role is hybrid that gets you a Spell/Trap, though with the current design of the Field Spell at least that isn't quite enough to be a one card starter ...
		
		Some practical considerations:
		=> condition for SS should allow for non-Kraata since you want a bit of splashability with the Field Spell search, and don't want to be screwed by the existence of Rahkshi and Makuta
		==> therefore, make it a DARK Fiend limitation, to align with the lock
		=> also the lock should not prevent Energized Protodermis Destiny from working once we get the Rahkshi Armor, so we're being a bit unusual and only restriciting Effect Monsters (so the Token is still fine!)
		=> forcing SS in Attack Position is kind of a waste of words, since Yubel can already do the invincible blocker thing way better, there's plenty of outside ways to SS these in Defense, and the fact that we want to attack for proactive removal means there's incentive to put them in Attack as well
		==> then again, that last point doesn't apply to the passive ones, so maybe they alone should be Attack Position only after all?

		If this was a Kraata, it would make extending combos a lot easier

		=> however, the summoning shortcut and materials become kinda recursive at that point unless we waste more words to avoid that
		=> or just make the Field Spell work with DARK Fiends generically, there we go
		==> not quite, would also need certain SS requirements to tolerate it

card:
	has styling: false
	notes:
		There are a lot of possible material clauses for these - canonically, it's 1 Kraata evolved into armor and 1 other Kraata of the same Type
		=> 2x Kraata Za is too restrictive
		=> Kraata Za + Rahkshi Armor hard requires access to Armor
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Kraata is convenient, but clearly missing a step; also you wouldn't be able to use Rahkshi Armor if that's a card with e.g. a Fusion effect
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Rahkshi lets us use the Armor and also repurpose other Rahkshi, but falsely suggests you can swap the Kraata between different armors
		=> Kraata Za + 1 Level 4 or higher Fiend has some enticing benefits
		==> can use Rahkshi Armor by making it a L4+ Fiend
		==> can use another Kraata if it's been boosted enough
		===> if it's the same Type as the power-granting one, its Level counts towards the ATK, so you get a reward for doing it correctly!
		==> can use some generic stuff maybe (anything broken?)

		{{Special Summon this card}}
		{{Equip 1 "Avohkii" Equip Spell}}
		
		Takua is the one who finds the Avohkii, so he gets you the Equip Spells
		=> can equip to any Avohkii monster because he passes it off to Jaller (and also because it makes him lose less hard to Ghost Ogre, Book of Moon, and so on)
		=> slightly more convoluted SS procedure: Activate (that's), reveal (why), Special Summon (they call me), send to GY (the Chronicler!)
		==> you get to keep the card if you already have another Avohkii-adjacent card present, so it's cheaper to extend than to start
		==> the Poplar pattern would have been an alternative going into a similar direction, but that can't extend after getting stopped and unlike Snake-Eyes we don't have a lot of other options
		==> upon rewatching, this actually isn't the right rythm ("they call" and "me" are separate!), but if you leave out the activation (or include it if you have the setup to not send) it still fits "be, right, there"
		==> arguably makes more sense for this to just be a regular SS if you control an Avohkii card anyway, because with this starter you can actually get something else from the Jaller search, so using the NS is justified - but let's leave that question open for the next version, when we have more Avohkii cards

		=> arguably makes more sense to swap the target pools since you don't see a lot of Turaga playing Kolhii and the Principles apply to the entire Matoran society, but not sure how well that would work for splashability
		==> should be fine since either way at least works with Hahli, and in general the principle effects are things that are good to use with the archetypal lower-tier monsters rather than any generic Extra Deck bosses they might be making
		==> However, a double attack for any WATER or Warrior is maybe too quickly game-ending, will have to watch out for that
		===> make it only Warriors, that matches with other Kolhii cards
		
		Principle of Purity: Prevent outside intereference in your plays
		=> targeted negate of monster effect that also hits one of your own, but if it's a Quick Effect you can chain it so Ga-Matoran have an advantage
		==> unless, of course, the thing you're negating was a response to your Ga-Matoran effect, so this might be a bit of a wonky approach to the intended use case
		==> generally negating responses risks being a bit toxic in a turn 1 combo, and conflicts with Ga-Koro not allowing those responses in the first place
		==> would make sense to be able to target any opponent's card, but then it's kinda just Drillbeam ...
		===> eh, distinct enough since we do have to target our own monster too
		=> destruction after negation is tied to a variant of Ga-Koro's GY purity condition, so we have that interpretation included as well

		NS Jaller => +1 (Warrior)
		SS Takua => +2 (LIGHT Warrior)
		Jaller + Takua -> Takanuva => +4 (Level 7 LIGHT Warrior ED monster)
		=> If Jaller searched Takua and Takua equipped Avohkii, you're down to 4 cards in hand at this point, and your field is Takanuva + the Avohkii that re-equipped itself
		=> therefore, draw 1; up to draw 5 if you used up the rest of your hand somehow, draw 6 if you choose not to equip Avohkii - maybe too easy?
		==> could also have the draw "During the Standby Phase"
		=> Final condition is ED monster so it works with all the Rahi party members, could also be Tuner for Takanuva hinting but either way it feels a bit odd
		
		Meanwhile, for the initial wave:
		NS Jaller => +1 (Warrior)
		SS Takua => +2 (LIGHT Warrior)
		SS Pewku => +1
		SS backup Jaller or Graalok => +1
		SS Ka => +1
		=> so we end 1 short and need to stack more in opponent's turn, really might need some other effect ...
		=> with a revive on activation, we get there even off Pewku by using Graalok to make Ka float and bringing back Pewku for an extra counter!
		==> ironically, opening with it before you have something to revive ends up with fewer counters unless you have a spare extender, since you can't do the back half of the sequence
		
		Limited to Avohkii mentioners a) so it's not totally splashable (though I suspect it's too slow to be justifiable as an unsearchable card anyway) and b) so it has an Avohkii mention itself
		=> could also cover the latter by having some additional effect so it gets value without needing to fill up everything (however, words)
		==> Idea 1: Once per turn, if a card(s) you control, that is "Great Kanohi Avohkii" or mentions it, would be destroyed by card effect, you can remove 1 counter from this card instead.
		==> Idea 2: When this card is activated: You can Special Summon 1 "Avohkii" monster from your hand or GY (this one makes it extra good with Pewku, but has like zero lore justification)
		
		Note: Searchable by Seventh Ascension, but who cares, I'm not bastardizing muh movie quote

		=> bounces itself for a monster search so you can reveal it later in the combo, but does take a card out of your hand so you don't get a repeatable +1 every turn
		==> still a +1 as far as hand advantage goes, but -1 on the field due to self-bounce
		==> can also search the real Avohkii as if "unsealing" itself, the lore-friendly idea being that you then send the Sealed form to the GY
		===> overall it might be smoother and more practical to instead have the ignition search be only monsters and have the Avohkii search happen if it's destroyed by a card effect, so your opponent popping it preemptively doesn't rob you of your reveal target; but that:
		====> takes more words
		====> gives it an entire effect to exclusively search a card that at present does not exist
		====> we'll decide after some more testing

		Disruptive Spell/Trap payoff for Avohkii combos
		=> since it's very on-theme for this to work by just having an Avohkii in hand, it doesn't require on-field setup, so the basic effect has to be a bit toned down (compared to, say, RR Glorious Bright)
		==> base version: target is stunned by the light
		==> plus version: fricken lasers (showing Avohkii = shaking Avohkii)
		==> combination makes it so you can S E N D without worrying about direct floating
		
		Utility GY effect to give us a recycling option
		=> also dodges GY removal thanks to being a trap
		
		Not really a movie quote, but kind of the title in reverse
		=> most fitting direct quote would be "Trust in the Mask", though that sounds more like it would do something protective

		=> initial payoff is Jaller, Takua, and an extra search
		=> then the Extra Deck (Rahi mounts) let you get more value out of that while always looping back to Jaller + Takua

		Jaller is the general searcher for everything EXCEPT Equip Spells - he's in charge of the quest, but not the one who finds the actual mask

		==> what if: SS during Main Phase (or Battle Phase?) as Quick Effect, and Fusion Summon when a monster attacks?
		
		On field, just makes Ta-Matoran Guards during BP

		Fuse your monsters after they attacked in order to attack some more

		=> provides infinite Ta-Koro fodder (remember: remove the HOPT on that one!), but doesn't let you keep it past the Battle Phase, so better use it
		==> of course, a Quick-Play Spell (e.g. Courage) can also be fired before it expires
		==> however, buff stacking might actually become a problem with non-HOPT Ta-Koro and a native multi-attacker (fix the buff to original ATK + boost maybe)?
