	notes:
		Already has overhaul effects.
		
		Further overhaul should do the following:
		-) Feasible boss monster for Ta-Koro deck
		-) Feasible part of a multi-Toa deck (Kaita or even all six)
		-) Depict the process of being lost in the ocean for a long time before finally coming to rescue the Matoran somehow (e.g. SS condition that requires (FIRE) monsters in your GY and opponent to control monsters)
		
		General Toa Mata effect structure:
		1) Allow Tributes from hand (maybe with some restriction like not attacking the turn it's summoned like that?)
		2) Effect supporting the Koro's playstyle
		3) Kanohi cycling
		
		For Tahu, 2) does ATK reduction to help with battle. Could also be a continuous effect, or only trigger on own summon (but be more powerful), or do burn damage when a FIRE monster destroys a monster by battle, or do something on attack declaration (could be safely activated in combination with Hau, since Tahu can then just attack whatever) ...
		Maybe: "Once per turn, when a monster you control gains ATK: You can make all monsters your opponent controls lose the same amount of ATK." Downside: Doesn't activate on own summon.
		
		Alt 2): Once per turn, before damage calculation: ... (more flexible)
		
		
		Problem with fancy new Kanohi equipping effect: Link Isolde, send 6 Kanohi, Special Summon Toa --> any 2 Warriors equal a nearly free Toa Mata able to cycle through the full ass of protection and buffs
		=> too easy, especially since the key card is entirely unrelated to the archetype
		=> on the other hand, running 6 different Kanohi is a gimmick deck anyway, so maybe Isolde enabling that isn't too bad
		=> but Golden Kanohi should definitely be changed

		Principle: Courage
		"To be courageous is to place your responsibility and the safety of others above your own safety."
		=> face stronger monsters in battle
		=> shield allies (force opponent to attack a specific monster, e.g. "Your opponent cannot target FIRE monsters you control for attacks, except the FIRE monster with the highest ATK you control"?) 
		=> better: protect from effects while controlling multiple FIRE, so opponent is forced into battle
		
		Courage grants Strength 
		=> ATK manipulation
		
		The enemy of Courage is Fear
		=> Fear prevents battles from taking place by making monsters "flee"
		
		Battle focus has good synergy with Hau's battle protection.
		Huna forces attacks towards stronger targets, might be redundant with the possible "shield allies" effect listed above.
		
		ATK boost could also be before damage calculation, so you can chain block with this and Tahu, and the opponent gets a chance to add additional boosts afterwards (more courageous that way).

		Principle: Purity
		"To be pure was to free your thoughts of corruption."
		=> prevent your monsters from being negatively affected
		=> negate targeting effects
		
		Purity grants Speed
		=> evasion by dodging effects goes well with interpretation of purity
		=> but could also be "speed" as a game term, with things like giving draws or making things quick effects
		
		The enemy of Purity is Poison
		=> negative effect that somehow bypasses/overpowers Purity's protection?
		
		Kaukau protecting from Spells/Traps fits in, but might be redundant.
		Rau currently has no relevance - possible changes?
		=> maybe "translate" one type of effect into another so protection works?
		
		Alternate approach: Purity = having a group of cards be homogenous (e.g. only WATER monsters in GY)

		Principle: Prosperity
		"One was prosperous by attaining great wealth, often through hard work."
		=> wealth = card advantage?
		=> wealth = LP?
		=> hard work = performing summons?
		
		Prosperity grants Stamina.
		=> helps with executing more hard work
		
		The enemy of Prosperity is Hunger.
		=> saps away whatever resource are needed for hard work
		=> currently would just make opponent gain LP, so not really relevant
		=> unless: hard work is reducing opponent's LP
		
		Pakari's ATK boost seems to fit in more with Ta-Koro's playstyle, though it would be redundant there.
		=> if hard work is reducing opponent's LP, a bigger beatstick would have some synergy
		Ruru currently has no relevance.
		=> maybe inflict damage based on revealed card, like Aqua Dolphin

		Block effects on attack

		Interesting concept: stackable activations delayed to End Phase (Inflict damage on SS/draw when leave field) => can it somehow be included? Would be nice as a lore adaptation. Original wording:
		"When this card is Special Summoned: Inflict damage equal to its current ATK to your opponent during the End Phase of this turn. When this card leaves the field: Draw 1 card during the End Phase of this turn."
		
		Maybe:
		During the End Phase: Your opponent takes 200 damage for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Or:
		During the End Phase: Draw 1 card for each FIRE monster you Special Summoned this turn.
		
		Both could also activate from GY, only count some subset of FIRE monsters, count field leaves instead of summons, ...
